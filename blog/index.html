I have difficulty keeping letters in order, seeing the gaps between words, and with ADHD on top, I lose focus A LOT. 			The immersive reader has been my new best friend. It drowns out the rest of the content on the page, changes the font to something I can read, and highlights the word as it reads to me. My eyes are forced to keep going in the right direction. I can slow down and pay attention to what I'm reading. I don't even have to go back and read the same paragraph 5 times to understand it! The screen overlay has been outstanding for eye strain and being able to distinguish between words and spaces. The custom font and spacing for research articles have been an enormous advantage! I can actually read the research papers now and not have this daunting 2 column fine print page to squint over.All around, this has been the best purchase I've ever had. I use this every day, with every assignment. I don't even struggle with story-based questions anymore. The immersive reader helps me read, listen, and understand the question all at once. I am still exploring what I can use this with and how it can make my academic career, and I keep getting impressed with every new way I find to use it. Seriously, try it out. You won't regret it at all. Even if you don't have dyslexia or ADHD, just try it out. You might find that it helps you understand the content you're trying to learn even better!",

So amazing that I posted a YouTube tutorial within days of installing it.

When you do get access to the Pro version or other paid plans, you expand your opportunity to read and stay focused better. One of the other great things about Helperbird is their support service. They have a video for every single feature that you can use. They are simple and helpful videos that make the learning process a lot easier. In addition, they have great live chat support. They are super nice and helpful. They always encourage people to give suggestions on how to improve Helperbird. Why is this important? It shows they really care about people with disabilities or people in general.",

It helped tremendously! And I loved that the text-to-speech has such a fluid voice compared to a lot of others I've used! Honestly, the fact that this was created by someone who knows the struggles is something I love, because then it has neurodivergency in mind. I've tried too many things in the past that were created by neurotypical folk trying to be helpful to us and I do appreciate it, but it doesn't work as well because our brains work different.

It's very accurate so there aren't many issues with accuracy but if they do happen then we've communicated about them immediately (within hours). Sometimes some of our documents are not saved correctly which can lead us into trouble at times as well; however nothing too major has come up during these two years since purchasing this program from helper bird!! If looking solely towards price or cost effectiveness look elsewhere.  Our main goal within office automation/efficiency comes first here where helping others complete their jobs quicker without having anyone else involved makes things fly along smoothly especially now-a days thanks COVID 19 pandemic - people need help getting information quickly & efficiently while working remotely due to quarantine restrictions etc.. This does just what its intended doing perfectly.",

It also has many options so it's not only limited towards reading but there are plenty additional functions as well! Sometimes when i open up an article with helpeer birds voiceover option then sometimes if try again after sometime nothing happens even though everything seems fine initially? That would be really frustrating especially because most times we rely heavily on these types of tools while trying access information online through our phones etc. So this could definitely help people who have difficulty accessing certain content using their devices/phones.",

People with dyslexia can be as smart and as capable as their neurotypical peers. Dyslexia isn't a career sentence or a limitation.
