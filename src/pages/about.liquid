      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">Hey there!,</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        I'm Robert James Gabriel, the founder of Helperbird. I want to share with you the story of how Helperbird came to be back in 2015.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        I grew up in Ireland, and school was always a challenge for me. I struggled with in-class work, homework, and tests. At 15, my English teacher suggested that I drop out of school, which was devastating for me and my family.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        But my parents didn't give up on me. They had me tested and discovered that I had dyslexia. With the right support, I was able to turn things around and even won my school 8,000 euro in award money.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        Fast forward a few years, and I was interning at a software company called
        <a
        href="https://www.teamwork.com"
        target="_blank"
        class="leading-relaxed font-sans text-base md:text-lg link link-hover text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700"
        title="Visit Teamwork - Project Management, Help Desk & Chat Software">
        Teamwork.com
      </a>. During my internship, I built the very first version of Helperbird. It was initially designed to help me study and browse the web more efficiently, but it quickly grew into something more significant.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        Since then,
        <a
          href="/products/chrome/"
          title="Helperbird for Google Chrome"
          class="leading-relaxed font-sans  text-base md:text-lg link link-hover text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Helperbird</a>
        has evolved and helped countless people with and without learning difficulties. It's my life's goal to make the web more accessible and easier to use for everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        Helperbird's mission started with me and my needs, but it's grown to become something much more significant. We want to ensure that reading is never a barrier to learning, whether you have dyslexia, concussion symptoms, ADD, low vision, or anything in between.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed font-sans   text-xl  text-black mb-6">
        Our free version and low-cost version allow us to continue working on Helperbird and making it accessible to everyone. It's truly heartwarming to see productivity lovers, with and without learning differences, use Helperbird to reach their full potential.
      </p>

        Thank you for taking the time to learn about Helperbird and our mission.
