      The Story Behind Helperbird
    </h1>
    <p class="mx-auto mt-6 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-relaxed text-zinc-600 sm:text-xl">
      Helperbird started as a simple idea by Robert James Gabriel back in 2015, born from his own need to make learning less of a struggle. 
      <br>
      <br>
      What began as a personal project quickly turned into something bigger â€“ a way to help anyone who wants an easier way to learn and succeed.

    <p class="text-lg">Hey there! ðŸ‘‹,</p>
    
    <p>
      I'm Robert James Gabriel, the founder (and the one and only developer!) behind Helperbird. This project wasn't just a business, it was personal, created from my own experiences and needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Growing up in Ireland, school was a struggle. When I was 15, <a href="#" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline decoration-blue-600/30 underline-offset-2 transition-colors hover:text-blue-700 hover:decoration-blue-700" title="Read about my story in the Irish Times">my English teacher told my parents I should drop out</a>. That news was devastating, but my parents didn't give up on me. After testing, they discovered I had dyslexia, and with their support, I was able to turn things around. I went on to win an award that brought my school 8,000 euros â€“ something I couldn't have achieved without my parents' belief in me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In January 2015, during an internship at <a href="https://www.teamwork.com" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline decoration-blue-600/30 underline-offset-2 transition-colors hover:text-blue-700 hover:decoration-blue-700" title="Visit Teamwork's website">Teamwork.com</a>, I created the first version of Helperbird to learn coding and help me study. What started as a small tool to make web browsing easier quickly grew into something much bigger. And coming up on ten years now, it's still just me here, developing and supporting Helperbird to keep it going strong all these years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Helperbird's mission is simple: to make reading, learning, and navigating the web easier and more accessible for everyone. Whether you have dyslexia, low vision, ADHD, or just want tools to improve focus and productivity, Helperbird is here for you. I offer a free version to ensure accessibility for all and keep Pro features affordable to support ongoing improvements. Accessibility isn't just a feature in Helperbird â€“ it's the heart of what I do. I'm committed to building a tool that meets or exceeds accessibility standards, so it's usable by anyone who needs it.
