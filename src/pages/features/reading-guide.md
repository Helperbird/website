## What Is This Feature?

Helperbird's Reading Guide helps you stay focused while reading by visually guiding your eyes along the text. This reduces distractions, improves comprehension, and makes reading smoother and more comfortable. Itâ€™s a helpful tool for students, researchers, and anyone looking to enhance their reading experience.

## What Are the Benefits?

- **Improve Reading Speed:** Guide your eyes along the text to read more fluently.  
- **Reduce Eye Strain:** Minimize fatigue during long reading sessions.  
- **Enhance Focus:** Stay concentrated on the text without distractions.  
- **Support Reading Challenges:** Provides visual tracking for individuals with dyslexia or other reading difficulties.

## How It Works

The Reading Guide is based on the principle of **visual tracking**. By providing a visible guide or bar, it helps your eyes stay aligned with the text, reducing the cognitive load required to follow each line. This can improve focus and make reading feel less overwhelming, especially for individuals with dyslexia or visual processing challenges.

The guide helps reduce the chance of **regression**, where the eyes unintentionally move backward while reading. It also minimizes the effects of **saccadic eye movements**, where the eyes jump between lines of text, which can disrupt comprehension and fluency.

For people with visual sensitivities or eye strain, the adjustable color and transparency settings provide additional comfort, making the text easier to follow and reducing fatigue.

- **Professionals:** Improve concentration while reading work documents or emails.
