## How Does It Work?

Reading Mode is based on principles of **cognitive load reduction** and **visual ergonomics**, which aim to make reading less mentally and visually taxing:


**Decluttering Content:** By removing ads, flashing images, and other distractions, Reading Mode reduces unnecessary stimuli that compete for your attention. This helps you focus entirely on the text.  

**Customizable Settings:** Adjusting fonts, colors, and spacing makes the text easier to process, reducing eye strain and increasing readability. For example, wider line spacing can help users with dyslexia by reducing the overlap of letters.  

**Improving Accessibility:** Text-to-speech and font customization cater to users with reading challenges like dyslexia or ADHD. Studies show that altering fonts and colors can improve reading speed and comprehension for certain users.  

**Reducing Cognitive Load:** Simplified layouts make it easier for your brain to process the content, improving focus and retention.  

By tailoring the reading environment to the user, Reading Mode creates a more comfortable and efficient experience, whether you're reading for work, study, or leisure.
