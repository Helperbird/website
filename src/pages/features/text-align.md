## What Is Text Alignment?

Text alignment refers to how text is arranged on a page, which affects readability and aesthetics. Common alignment types include:  

**Left-Aligned:** Text starts at the left edge, commonly used for body text.  

**Right-Aligned:** Text starts at the right edge, often used for design purposes.  

**Center-Aligned:** Text is centered, great for titles or emphasis.  

**Justified:** Text is spaced evenly on both the left and right sides, giving a clean, professional appearance.

By allowing you to customize alignment, Helperbird helps create a reading experience tailored to your needs.
