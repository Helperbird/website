## What Is This Feature?

Helperbird’s Custom Colors feature lets you adjust text, background, and link colors on any website. Changing colors can make text easier to read, reduce glare, and help you focus. This is especially helpful for people with dyslexia or visual impairments, with suggested dyslexia-friendly color combinations included.

Colors play an important role in how we process information. For example, softer background colors can reduce glare, and higher contrast can make text clearer for people with low vision. This feature gives you control to create a more comfortable and personalized browsing experience.
