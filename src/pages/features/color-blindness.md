## What Is This Feature?

Helperbird's Color Blindness Support feature is designed to make links and text easier to see for people with color vision challenges. It works by underlining and outlining links, so they stand out more on web pages and are easier to click.

This feature is especially useful for people with Protanopia or Deuteranopia, two common types of color blindness. By making links more noticeable, Helperbird helps create a smoother and more accessible browsing experience.

## More About This Feature

Color blindness can make browsing the web harder, especially when links rely only on color to stand out. For example, people with Protanopia or Deuteranopia often struggle to see links that blend into the surrounding text.

Helperbird fixes this by adding underlines and outlines to links, so they’re always easy to see and click. This small change makes a big difference in creating a more inclusive and user-friendly web experience.
