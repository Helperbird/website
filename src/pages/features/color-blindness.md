## More About This Feature

Helperbird helps with common types of color blindness, like Protanopia and Deuteranopia, which affect many people. These types of color blindness can make it hard to see links that are just a different color from the text.

With Helperbird, links are underlined and outlined in different colors. This makes them stand out, so they are easier to see and click.
