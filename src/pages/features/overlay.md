## What Is This Feature?

Helperbird's Overlay feature allows you to customize how any website looks by adding a tint or overlay. You can adjust brightness, contrast, and color to make reading easier and reduce eye strain. This feature is especially beneficial for people with visual impairments, light sensitivity, or Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome (Irlen Syndrome), as it helps reduce distortions and makes text clearer. 

Bright web pages can often cause discomfort, but Helperbird lets you change the overlay color and opacity for a more comfortable and accessible reading experience.
