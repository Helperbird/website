## What Is This Feature?

Alt tags provide short descriptions of images or links, offering extra context to users. When you hover over an image or link, the alt tag shows up as a tooltip, giving you quick details about what you’re looking at.

This is especially helpful for people who use screen readers or have visual impairments, as it gives them a way to understand images and links they can’t see. But it’s not just about accessibility—alt tags make websites easier to use for everyone by adding helpful context.

**Accessibility**: For people with visual impairments, alt tags provide critical information through screen readers or tooltips, making websites easier to navigate.

**Better Usability**: Even for everyday users, having quick access to extra details makes interacting with websites simpler and more intuitive.
