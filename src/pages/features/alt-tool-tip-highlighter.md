## Tell Me About This Feature

Alt tags provide a brief description of the content of an image or a link. When users hover over an image or link, the alt tag appears as a tooltip, giving extra information about the content.

This is especially helpful for users who are visually impaired and use screen readers to navigate websites. They rely on alt tags to understand the content of images and links, as they cannot see the images themselves.

Additionally, alt tags can improve the accessibility and usability of a website for all users by giving more context and information about the content they interact with.

## Benefits

Seeing image titles and link alt tags can improve the user experience in several ways:

### Image Titles
Image titles can give extra information about an image, such as its source, copyright details, or a caption.

### Link Alt Tags
Link alt tags can provide more context about the link's destination, helping users decide whether to click on it.

### Cognitive or Visual Impairments
Being able to see image titles and link alt tags on hover can help users with cognitive or visual impairments to better understand and navigate the website. It gives users a clearer idea of what to expect when they click on a link or image, improving overall usability.

## Features

- Show alt tags on images when you hover over them.
- Show title tags on links when you hover over them.

## Is This a Free Helperbird Feature?
