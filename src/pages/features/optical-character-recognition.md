## What Is OCR?

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It’s a technology that converts text from images or scanned documents into machine-readable text. By selecting the area you want to extract, OCR processes the text so it can be edited, searched, or stored digitally. It’s commonly used for digitizing printed materials like books, newspapers, and PDFs.
