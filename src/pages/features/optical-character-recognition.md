## What is OCR?

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition.

It's a technology that uses software to recognize and convert text that appears in images or scanned documents into machine-readable text. 

Essentially, OCR is used to digitize written or typed text into a format that can be edited, searched and stored on a computer. 

It reads the text from an image or a pdf document and converts it into editable text so that it can be edited, searched, indexed, and stored in a database. 

This technology is widely used to automate the process of digitizing books, newspapers, magazines, and other printed materials, making them accessible in digital format.
