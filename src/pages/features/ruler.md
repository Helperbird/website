## How Does It Work?

The Dyslexia Reading Ruler is based on principles of **visual tracking** and **line-by-line guidance**. For many readers, especially those with dyslexia, the brain struggles to process large blocks of text without losing place or focus. The ruler acts as a visual anchor, guiding the eyes across each line and reducing the cognitive load required to track text.

The customizable colors and sizes also help reduce visual stress caused by harsh contrasts or overwhelming layouts, making it easier to focus and stay engaged while reading.
