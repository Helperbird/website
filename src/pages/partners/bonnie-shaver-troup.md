## About

Founded in 2000, LEXEND came about from a desire to make reading easier for everyone. As an Educational Therapist, Bonnie Shaver-Troup, EdD, observed that reading issues masked the individual’s true capability and intelligence. She theorized that these issues were a sensitivity to typographical factors and began manipulating multiple text factors to find a match between text format and an individual’s optimized visual processing capabilities.





## Intro

After careful research and years of testing LEXEND beta fonts, Bonnie was able to determine that while traditional approaches to reading issues focused on cognitive-based solutions, perception-based solutions were faster and more efficient in helping improve reading performance and cognition.

In 2017 Bonnie began working with Google to design an online variable-font solution that would ultimately give the reader complete control over their own reading experience and improve retention and comprehension.

What began as a seed in the home office of an educational therapist has become a world-class reading solution available to English-language readers across the world.
