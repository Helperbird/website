			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">Hey there!,</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				I'm Robert James Gabriel, the founder of Helperbird. I want to share with you the story
				of how Helperbird came to be back in 2015.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				I grew up in Ireland, and school was always a challenge for me. I struggled with
				in-class work, homework, and tests. At 15, my English teacher suggested that I drop out
				of school, which was devastating for me and my family.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				But my parents didn't give up on me. They had me tested and discovered that I had
				dyslexia. With the right support, I was able to turn things around and even won my
				school 8,000 euro in award money.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				Fast forward a few years, and I was interning at a software company called Teamwork.
				During my internship, I built the very first version of Helperbird. It was initially
				designed to help me study and browse the web more efficiently, but it quickly grew into
				something more significant.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				Since then, Helperbird has evolved and helped countless people with and without learning
				difficulties. It's my life's goal to make the web more accessible and easier to use for
				everyone.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				Helperbird's mission started with me and my needs, but it's grown to become something
				much more significant. We want to ensure that reading is never a barrier to learning,
				whether you have dyslexia, concussion symptoms, ADD, low vision, or anything in between.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black  mb-6">
				Our free version and low-cost version allow us to continue working on Helperbird and
				making it accessible to everyone. It's truly heartwarming to see productivity lovers,
				with and without learning differences, use Helperbird to reach their full potential.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">
				Thank you for taking the time to learn about Helperbird and our mission.
			</p>
			<p class="text-xl leading-8 text-black mb-6">Thank you,</p>
