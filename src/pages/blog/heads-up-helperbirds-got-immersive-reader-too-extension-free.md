## Greetings, Helperbird Family! ðŸ‘‹

As the founder of Helperbird, I've been deeply engaged in the conversations about the challenges faced by many of you with the ["Use Immersive Reader on Website" Chrome extension.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/use-immersive-reader-on-w/fmidkjgknpkbmninbmklhcgaalfalbdh) This extension, is amazing but this error is appearing. The error message **"newselaimmersivereader.cognitiveservices.azure.comâ€™s server IP address could not be found,"** suggesting the extension may no longer be under active development.

## Addressing the Challenge: The Solution with Helperbird

In light of this, I want to reach out directly, especially to those who might discover this post through forums like Reddit, and introduce the solution we've crafted at Helperbird. We have developed our own Immersive Reader feature not just as an alternative, but as an enhancement, supporting a wide range of platforms including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and iOS.
