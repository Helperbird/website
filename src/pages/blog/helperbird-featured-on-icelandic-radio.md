We’re excited to share that Helperbird was recently mentioned on Iceland’s national radio station, **RÚV**, in a segment by **Bergmann Guðmundsson**. Bergmann is a fantastic person, a friend of Helperbird, and someone who truly understands the importance of accessibility in technology.

The discussion focused on how systems sometimes don’t work well together, creating challenges for people who need extra support. Bergmann highlighted how Helperbird helps solve this problem by giving users tools that make reading, writing, and focusing easier—whether they’re in school, at work, or just browsing online.
