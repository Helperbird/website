## Fact one

Despite popular belief, dyslexics do not see letters backwards. They often have difficulty naming
and writing letters, and in fact, writing letters backwards is something that many kids do when
they’re first learning to write, whether they have dyslexia or not.

## Fact two

Most dyslexics often have a better use of their right brain.

## Fact three

Dyslexics score significantly higher on test when they are given the test orally.

## Bonus cat fact

There are over 500 million domestic cats in the world. And and estimated 700 million Dyslexics. So
if you ever are feeling alone just know that there’s at least 6 million 9 hundred thousand nine
hundred and ninety nine other people like you and plenty of kitties to cuddle.
