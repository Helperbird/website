We're excited to announce the next big release of [Helperbird](https://www.helperbird.com/), the popular accessibility extension that helps users customize their browsing experience to meet their unique needs. This release, set to launch on June 4th, includes a host of new features and improvements that make Helperbird even more versatile and user-friendly than ever before. Let's take a closer look at what's in store.

## Bottom Navigation: Split into Writing, Reading, and Accessibility

One of the most significant changes in this release is the new bottom navigation, which has been split into three distinct categories: Writing, Reading, and Accessibility. This makes it easier for users to quickly find the tools they need based on the task they're working on, whether that's writing a document, reading an article, or customizing their browsing experience for accessibility.

## Maths Solving Support and Immersive Reader Support for Maths

Another major addition to Helperbird is maths solving support, which allows users to input equations and have them solved instantly. This is a game-changer for students, teachers, and anyone who needs to work with mathematical equations regularly. Additionally, Helperbird now includes Immersive Reader support for maths, which can help users better understand and visualize complex equations by breaking them down step-by-step.

## Epub Support and Offline Support

Helperbird now also includes support for Epub files, which means users can read Epub documents directly within the extension. This is a welcome addition for anyone who frequently works with Epub files, whether for personal or professional reasons. Plus, Helperbird now offers offline support, which means users can access all their customized settings and tools even when they don't have an internet connection.

## Better UI for Getting Used to Helperbird

To make it easier for new users to get started with Helperbird, we've also added a new onboarding UI that guides them through the various features and settings available. This ensures that users can start customizing their browsing experience right away, without feeling overwhelmed or confused.

## Over 30 Major Fixes and Improvements

Finally, this release includes over 30 major fixes and improvements, including better compatibility with PDF files, enhanced color contrast options, and improved keyboard navigation. These changes are designed to make Helperbird more stable, reliable, and user-friendly than ever before.

We can't wait for our users to try out the new and improved Helperbird, set to launch on June 4th. Whether you're a student, teacher, professional, or anyone who wants to customize their browsing experience, Helperbird has something to offer. Try it out for yourself and see how it can transform the way you browse the web.
