On March 25, 2025, Helperbird had the privilege of collaborating with the University of Alaska for an interactive webinarâ€”and it truly set a new benchmark for accessibility in action.

## Hands On Helperbird Training

I joined the University of Alaskas  educators and staff live to showcase Helperbirdâ€™s suite of tools: text-to-speech, dyslexia-friendly fonts, translation services, color overlays, and more. Together, we explored real-time demonstrations, adjusted settings on the fly, and celebrated those **aha** moments when small tweaks reveal their big impact on learning.

## A Surprise in Real Time

Just when I thought things couldnâ€™t get more inclusive, the University of Alaska surprised everyone by splitting the screen to introduce **the interpreter**, who provided live sign-language translation of every word I spoke. This wasnâ€™t a separate stream or delayed captions it was seamless, immediate, and heartfelt.

## Extending Accessibility Beyond the Live Event

the University of Alaskas  commitment didnâ€™t end when the webinar wrapped up. They promptly uploaded the recording to YouTube complete with full captions, ensuring that anyone who missed the live sessionâ€”or prefers readingâ€”can still engage with the material.

Why this matters:

- **True Engagement:** Deaf or hard-of-hearing participants could follow along, ask questions, and contribute in real time.

- **Best-Practice Demonstration**: UA didnâ€™t just discuss accessibility; they embodied it from planning through post-production.

- **Dignity and Respect**: This goes far beyond ticking compliance boxesâ€”itâ€™s about honoring everyoneâ€™s right to learn and participate.

## Salute to the University of Alaska
