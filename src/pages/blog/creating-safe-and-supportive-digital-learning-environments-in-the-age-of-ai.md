# Creating Safe and Supportive Digital Learning Environments In The Age of AI

Digital learning is a powerful educational tool. It expands the variety of options available to students with differing learning needs. It can also give access to resources that some students may not get from traditional schools alone. One of the current developments that can impact digital learning is artificial intelligence (AI).

Platforms driven by these systems can provide teachers and students with greater learning support tools and even enhanced digital safety measures. At the same time, there are risks to student well-being and learning quality associated with AI-driven education. Let’s take a look at some of the elements to be mindful of so that you and your students can engage effectively and safely.

## Prioritizing Communication

Digital learning environments in the age of AI can be a positive tool for helping students thrive even if they have unique needs. No matter the subject matter or student, one of the keys to the success of this type of education is good communication.

In terms of maintaining safety and support, it is vital to emphasize the importance of asking for help. Normalizing the idea that seeking assistance is a strength and not a weakness opens up opportunities for learning growth and positive connections for everyone. 

Importantly, it helps to safeguard students’ mental well-being, as knowing help is available can minimize the stress of facing challenges in isolation. Particularly when working online, which can present safety risks, recognizing the importance of asking for help when students are uncertain how to behave also leads to more informed decision-making.

You can strengthen your digital classroom by ensuring your students know which communication channels are available to ask for help. Make this as easy as possible for them but with options that suit different preferences. This could include instant messaging directly to you or another member of the teaching or welfare staff. 

It might also incorporate a calendar system for students to book video calls with you. It’s vital not to overlook peer support too. Chat groups where learners can ask one another for help and share experiences can be invaluable support while teaching them to collaborate.

Additionally, in the age of AI, chatbots are increasingly accessible. One option is to set up bots that can be another source of basic assistance for your students. They could ask questions regarding the curriculum or the subjects you’re teaching. You could also make chatbots available to inform students about the learning program and the tools they’re using or address any concerns. Remember though, to review data on what students are asking chatbots so you or other staff can follow up on queries, particularly with respect to safety, security, or welfare.

## Encouraging Media Literacy

With the growing importance of AI, it will continue to [affect media literacy](https://join1440.com/newsliteracy/media-literacy-in-the-age-of-ai) by making the subject more essential for education. While AI’s ability to provide personalized content can make for more relevant experiences, this also has the potential to lock users into an echo chamber of limited ideas and perspectives.

This is especially hazardous when misinformation comes into play. One of the risks with AI is that many platforms will still produce results with incorrect information or based on biases. When combined with virtual reality (VR), AI and its content can make the experience more impactful and engaging, which influences decision-making based on these items. 

As a digital educator, cultivating a variety of critical thinking can help your students navigate these tools and their risks with open eyes.

### What can you do to encourage greater media literacy?

1. **Provide technical literacy sessions**: Invite experts from the AI and VR industries to give talks to your students. These professionals can help your students gain insights into the difficulties of AI and help them understand signs of unreliable content.
   
2. **Activities to enhance critical thinking skills**: These activities might include debates over video classes with other students and presenting and countering evidence-based arguments. The curriculum doesn’t have to strictly be about AI, but all learning content should require students to consider different viewpoints and the veracity of evidence. Even project-based learning focusing on engineering or coding can help students think more critically and analytically.

Above all else, it is important to encourage students to ask questions. Emphasize the value of questioning the accuracy and origin of the media and data they receive. Teach them how to check for credible sources of information. In AI-supported VR, invite them to question the conscious and subconscious effects of the perspectives they’re exposed to. The stronger the critical faculties they can develop, the more media literate and safe they’re likely to be in the AI age.

## Providing a Tailored Learning Experience

One of the great things about AI in ed-tech is that it can provide personalized [learning plans to students](https://www.helperbird.com/blog/7-steps-to-create-personalised-learning-plans-for-students/). 

In essence, AI education platforms use machine learning algorithms to assess the curriculum alongside each student’s learning records and preferences. It then provides materials and lessons most suited to each student. This isn’t just a good method of educational support because it offers the most relevant resources. AI’s personalized learning paths also help students by enhancing [online safety](https://www.checkstep.com/educational-content-enhancing-online-safety-with-ai/), preventing students from accidentally finding inappropriate materials while searching online for resources themselves.

That said, it’s equally important to discuss with students about safely engaging with these platforms. The functioning of these tools is dependent on personal data. Talk to students about what data is collected, how it’s collected, and how the software uses it. 

Wherever possible, give not just parents but students control over what data related to their learning and personal preferences they share. This can get them into good habits for making informed decisions about data privacy that will serve them well as they engage with AI and other digital tools in their personal lives.

## Conclusion

Creating a safe and supportive digital learning environment involves leveraging and being mindful of AI. Alongside incorporating the personalized learning paths, preparing students to develop critical mindsets around bias, misinformation, and other issues is equally vital. 

As we’re still in the early days of AI in education, embracing it effectively will continue to be a learning experience in itself. Keep having discussions with students, their parents, and fellow educators about experiences with these platforms. Be open about the challenges and explore best practices that help everyone to gain from positive outcomes.
