## Build a Comfortable Workspace

A comfortable workspace requires three things: a sense of privacy, an ergonomic desk, and a
comfortable chair. After all, this is where you'll be spending the majority of your day.

Aside from the work equipment, you should also make sure to maintain the cleanliness of the
workspace. At Planet Maids Maid Service NYC, we believe that a clean and organized workspace can
impact your productivity. If there is too much clutter and dirt around, it can make you
uncomfortable, and it can even distract you.

By maintaining a clean home office, you can be more comfortable moving around, and you will have
fewer distractions.

## Set Realistic Goals and Track Your Progress

Don't expect to be productive if you don't have a direction to steer yourself towards each workday.

That's why it's ideal when you're working from home.

You set some daily goals for yourself, both short-term and long-term, and then track your progress.

That way, you have a visual of how good you're doing while you're working from home.

You should take the time to schedule and plan out your day the night before so that you can have a
plan of action the moment your day starts. It will help you align yourself and figure out what you
need to do so that you don't fumble around and do tasks that are not a priority.

## Create a Routine and Stick to It

What's most appealing about working from home is that you can be more flexible with how you work,
unlike when you're in the office.

However, some people can go way beyond this and not have any discipline regarding their workday.

Instead of falling for this frequent trap that people working from home fall into, try to create a
routine.

By establishing a work routine, you ensure that you get, at the very least, the prioritized tasks
done for the day. Once you get the hang of your routine, it can be easy to do your tasks even if you
feel unmotivated.

## Use Productivity-Enhancing Methods

If you're not sure about your work style, you might want to try out productivity methods that people
have tried and tested themselves.

There are plenty of routines and procedures surrounding productivity that people have applied. Just
because one thing works for another does not mean that it will work for you, so it'd be best to test
your methods first.

A popular productivity method that you could try out would be the time blocking approach.

The time blocking method is when you schedule a block of time where you do specific things, and
that's the only time you're allowed to do them.

For example, you schedule an hour at the start and end of the workday, and that's the only time you
can answer an email. That way, you don't find yourself going back and forth in your email throughout
the day.

You can also use productivity tools that accommodate your needs, which will help you focus more
while working.

## Schedule Breaks

Even if you love working and are a self-proclaimed workaholic, you are still prone to get burnt out,
even with a job you enjoy. A common reason why even workaholics burn out in a job they want is that
they don't take the time to schedule breaks throughout the workday.

Aside from your lunch break and the end of your workday, which you should follow through on, you
should also have small breaks in-between tasks. These small breaks allow you to recuperate and let
your mind rest for a bit before going back to work again.

Aside from that, don't forget to schedule vacations or holidays as well. These can help with your
motivation and productivity in the long run.

## Improve Focus with Exercise and Meditation

Another productivity-enhancing habit you should incorporate would have wellness activities.

Wellness activities include both fitness activities and practices that help you focus on your mental
state. By incorporating more wellness activities in your off time, you will have a better time when
you go back to work.

Having a balance between exercise and meditation can help improve your focus in the workplace. Yoga
is a perfect example of incorporating exercise and meditation in one, so you might want to try and
pick that up.

You can also separate exercise and meditation. What's important is that you do both of them for your
physical and mental well-being.

## Keep Socializing

You can't live your life focusing only on your career and your work life.

When you're working from home, it's much harder to carve time to socialize because you're at home.

That's why it would be best to keep in touch with your colleagues even if you are working from home.

Your colleagues aren't just there to chit-chat with you. They can also help keep you accountable.

Aside from socializing with your work colleagues, it is also a good idea to get in touch with
friends and family. Your private social network is going to help you realize that you have a life
outside of work.

The happier you are outside of work, the easier it is for you to be more productive once you get
back to your job.

## Devote Time to Self-Care

Self-care has increased attention over the past few years, but it doesn't mean that everyone has a
good self-care regimen.

Having a solid self-care regimen is another excellent way to avoid work from home burnout and
maximize your productivity. Self-care is more than just using skincare products and having a spa
day. It's all about focusing on things that will positively impact your life in one way or another.

If you have time to do activities that aren't necessarily good for you, then you have the time to
devote to self-care, so don't skip this step.
