## Keeping Our Users Safe While Sharing Their Stories

We change the names in our stories to keep our users safe. Even though the names are different, the stories are real. We respect the privacy of everyone who shares their story with us.


## Introduction:
Patricia Ferris, an experienced teacher, gave a big shoutout to Helperbird for their support in making learning easier for her students with different needs. This story shows how Helperbird's tools helped Patricia's students become more independent and confident learners.

## The Challenge
In Patricia's class, some students found learning difficult because they had different needs. Regular teaching methods didn't always work for everyone, making it tough to create an inclusive learning space.

## Discovering Helperbird
To help her students, Patricia found Helperbird, a tool that makes digital learning materials easier to use for people with different needs. She got help from Robert, a Helperbird representative, who gave her licenses and support to use the tool in her class.

## Helping Students with Accessibility Tools
Helperbird has different tools that Patricia's students found really useful:

1. **Read Aloud:** This tool reads out text, so students who had trouble reading could understand better. It made reading less stressful.

2. **Voice Typing:** Students who had difficulty typing could now speak their thoughts, and Helperbird would turn their words into text, making it easier to express themselves in writing.

3. **Translate:** For students who spoke different languages, Helperbird's Translate feature helped them understand the content in their preferred language, making learning more accessible.

4. **Customizable Fonts and Colors:** Helperbird lets students change how text looks, making it more comfortable to read based on their preferences.

5. **Adjustable Text and Line Spacing:** Some students liked reading with more space between words and lines. Helperbird let them do this, making reading easier.

## The Result
Using Helperbird made a big difference for Patricia's students:

- **Better Learning:** Students who used to struggle with reading, writing, and understanding started doing better in their schoolwork. They could learn more easily.

- **More Confidence:** As students became more independent in their learning, they felt more confident in class. They weren't held back by their differences anymore.

- **Inclusive Classroom:** Patricia's classroom became a place where every student, no matter their needs or language, could learn together and feel included.

## Conclusion
With Helperbird's help and its easy-to-use tools, Patricia Ferris and her students had a better learning experience. Students with different needs became more independent and confident learners. Helperbird played a big part in making education more inclusive and accessible for everyone.
