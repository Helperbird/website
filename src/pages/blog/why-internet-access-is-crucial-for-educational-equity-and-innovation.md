Less than a decade ago, high-speed reliable internet access was considered a luxury. Today, that paradigm has completely shifted as access to the web is now crucial for students and teachers alike.

Unfortunately, huge disparities exist among communities and their ability to access the web. This is a serious issue as [1.7 million households](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5803/ldselect/ldcomm/219/219.pdf) have no broadband or Wi-Fi access in the UK. Similarly, 5 million Brits still lack the basic computer skills they need to operate computers connected to the internet.

Addressing inequity in internet access should be a priority for educators. Providing fast reliable access empowers students who are searching for resources and ensures that all children can access high-quality learning materials. This is particularly important for children with learning disabilities who may need access to [adaptive lessons](https://www.helperbird.com/features/optical-character-recognition/) that are available online.

## Bridging the Digital Divide

The recent House of Lords report titled “Digital Exclusion” noted that addressing the digital divide and “improving basic digital skills in schools could help address educational inequalities as technology and online research become more embedded in the education system.” This sentiment was echoed by Dr. Jake Anders, Deputy Director at the Centre for Education Policy and Equalising Opportunities at University College London, who explained that lower internet access resulted in students being “less able to engage with their learning.”

Clearly, equitable access is a crucial issue that requires the attention of policymakers. While this has been subject to the proposed “levelling up” schemes, it appears that progress has been slow. While this can be frustrating, educators and parents can take matters into their own hands and [bridge the digital divide](https://www.compareinternet.com/blog/bridging-the-digital-divide/) by:

- Establishing what level of internet access is required (how many people will be using the web? What minimum speeds are required?)
- Determining which pieces of hardware are the most important to secure (will folks need cameras to engage with online learning? Or screen readers for adaptive needs?)
- Understanding the different options available in order to choose the right type of connection (fibre, DSL, satellite, or cable)
- Assessing the barriers to access and the solutions that other communities use to overcome them.

Working collaboratively with local councils may help educators and parents secure reliable access for their children. This is particularly important for folks who are currently receiving benefits and struggle to afford broadband. Help may be available in the form of social tariffs that cover or reduce the monthly bill.

Students can also find reliable access to the internet via their local library. The COVID-19 pandemic did shut some public libraries for good, but others have prospered recently due to the increased use of e-visits. Showing support for local libraries benefits public programs and convinces councils to keep their public institutions open. This benefits future learners too, who will likely rely on the same public PCs to gain access to STEM classes and online tuition.

## Internet Access and STEM Education

Reliable internet access is particularly important for students who want to pursue a STEM career. STEM requires access to high-quality educational materials that may not always be available through schooling. This is a serious issue in impoverished areas where Wi-Fi access is not readily available for students who take an interest in STEM and may form a barrier to educational access in STEM education.

Schools can boost diversity in STEM by increasing internet access to students who show an interest in subjects like science and maths. This can [aid efforts to overcome underrepresentation in STEM](https://www.4btengines.com/why-diversity-in-stem-matters-and-how-to-boost-participation-in-schools/) by:

- Helping students learn from diverse role models who reflect their own background.
- Increasing access to project-based learning, which engages students and helps them get hands-on experience with things like coding and automotive engineering.
- Providing access to educators who can answer tricky open-ended questions that have captured a student’s imagination.

Increasing interest in STEM is crucial as poor representation undermines efforts to produce programs and algorithms that authentically represent society’s needs. Providing equitable access to the web can also improve efforts to engage students with learning disabilities who want to pursue STEM. By accessing adaptive materials via online classes, these students can find ways to learn that suit them, which will ensure that everyone is properly represented.

## Connectivity and the Arts

Access to high-speed internet is also important for students who take an interest in the liberal arts. While all schools should be able to put on plays and offer drama classes, students with learning disabilities may struggle to connect with in-person classes. However, students who do have access to the internet can connect with supportive resources like:

- [The Globe’s “Learn” program](https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/learn/)
- [Travelling Light Theatre Company](https://www.travellinglighttheatre.org.uk/)
- [The Writing for Pleasure Centre](https://writing4pleasure.com/)
- [Music of Life](https://www.musicoflife.org.uk/)

These supportive resources can be adapted to suit students’ needs and give them an opportunity to learn at their own pace. This can be transformative for students who have an interest in the arts but struggle to connect with their school’s curriculums. Some of these programs provide online adaptive services for students who may benefit from an approach that differs from the national curriculum. By offering reliable internet access, students can connect with these resources and ignite a passion for the arts that lasts a lifetime.

## Conclusion

Internet access is increasingly important in today’s digital world. Students who do not have reliable access to high-speed broadband are at a distinct disadvantage to their well-connected peers. Parents and educators can bridge the digital divide by exploring budget-friendly access options that may be supported by local councils. This is particularly important for students with learning disabilities who may benefit greatly from adaptive online lessons.
