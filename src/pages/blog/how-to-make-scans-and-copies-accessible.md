## How to Make Scans and Copies Accessible for Students

Making scanned or copied documents accessible is simple and can make a huge difference for students using tools like Helperbird. Here’s how you can do it:

---

### 1. Enable OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

OCR makes scanned text readable and searchable by accessibility software.  

#### **On a Scanner:**  
1. Place the document flat on the scanner.  
2. Select the **OCR** or **Make Searchable PDF** option.  
3. Save the document as a PDF or Word file.  

#### **On a Phone App:**  
1. Use apps like Adobe Scan, Microsoft Lens, or Google Drive.  
2. Enable the OCR option during or after scanning.  
3. Save the file with text recognition enabled.

### 2. Keep Scans Straight  

A straight scan ensures the text is clear and easy to read.  

#### **On a Scanner:**  
1. Align the document with the scanner edges.  
2. Preview the scan and adjust if needed before saving.  

#### **On a Phone App:**  
1. Hold your phone steady and parallel to the document.  
2. Use the app’s auto-straighten tool if available.

### 3. Test Your File  

After scanning, test the document with accessibility tools like Helperbird to ensure:  
- Text is selectable and searchable.  
- The layout is clear and straight.  
- Text-to-speech or other tools work as expected.
