            <p>

                When Google Docs updated to the new Canvas version, it broke many extensions. Thankfully after a hard few weeks, word prediction is now back in Helperbird for Google Docs.
                
                                Just enable it and start typing. We also have improved the speaking rate and pitch with it too.
