Helperbird's PDF Reader makes working with PDF documents easier with built-in tools for reading, annotating, note-taking, and more. Open any PDF and access powerful features like voice typing, translation, text extraction, and summarization.

---

## Step 1: Open PDF in Helperbird

When viewing a PDF in your browser, look for the green **"Open PDF in Helperbird â€“ Click to Open"** button at the bottom of the page. Click this button to open the PDF in Helperbird's reader.


The PDF will load in Helperbird's reader interface with all tools available.



---

## Step 2: Navigate and Take Notes

Once your PDF is open, you'll see page numbers at the top for easy navigation. To open the note-taking panel, click the **note button** in the top toolbar. 

This will open a split view with your PDF on the left and a note editor on the right.


**Note-Taking Features**:

**Voice Typing**: Click the microphone icon to start dictating your notes instead of typing. Great for quickly capturing thoughts while reading.


**Grammar/Spell Check**: Click the "A" with checkmark icon to check your notes for spelling and grammar errors.

**Print**: Click the print icon to quickly print your notes.

**Download Options**: Click the download icon in the toolbar to see your options. You can download your notes separately, download the original PDF, or download the PDF with your annotations included.


---

## Step 3: Annotate Your PDF

Click the **Annotation Mode** button in the top toolbar to start adding text boxes and annotations directly onto your PDF pages. 

Once enabled, click anywhere on the PDF to add a text box where you can type your annotation.


---

## Step 4: PDF Text to Speech

Use the playback controls to manage your annotation workflow:

- **Play**: Continue adding annotations
- **Pause**: Temporarily stop annotation mode
- **Stop**: Exit annotation mode

---

## Step 5: Use Quick PDF Tools

Click the floating pink menu button on the right side of the screen to access quick tools for working with your PDF:

**Extract Text**: Pull text from the PDF to use in other documents or applications.

**Summarize**: Get a quick summary of the PDF content to understand key points faster.

**View in Immersive Reader**: Open the PDF in an immersive reading mode with enhanced readability features.

**Translate**: Translate the PDF content into different languages.


**Tip:** The PDF Reader combines all of Helperbird's powerful tools in one place, making it perfect for studying, research, and document review. Use voice typing for quick note-taking and Annotation Mode to mark up important sections directly on the PDF.
