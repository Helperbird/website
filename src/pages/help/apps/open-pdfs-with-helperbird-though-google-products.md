Helperbird now works seamlessly with Google products like **Drive**, **Gmail**, and **Docs**, allowing you to open PDFs directly in Helperbird’s built-in PDF reader.  

With this integration, you can use all your favorite accessibility tools — from text-to-speech to color overlays and dyslexia-friendly fonts — without having to leave Google’s interface.

## How to Enable Helperbird in the “Open with” Menu

### Step 1: Install the Helperbird Google Docs Add-on

Go to the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace) and search for **Helperbird**.  
Click **Install** and follow the steps to grant permissions.

**Tip:** You may need admin approval if you’re using a work or school Google account.

---

### Step 2: Make Sure You Have the Helperbird Extension Installed

Helperbird’s **Chrome extension** must also be installed to open PDFs in Helperbird.  
If you don’t have it yet, you can get it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/helperbird).

Once installed, make sure you’re logged in to your Helperbird account.

---

### Step 3: Open a PDF in Google Drive or Gmail

Open any PDF in **Google Drive** or **Gmail**. You’ll see a button at the top labeled **“Open with”**.

---

### Step 4: Choose Helperbird from the List

Click **Open with**, and you should now see **Helperbird** as one of the connected apps.

Select **Helperbird**, and the PDF will open in Helperbird’s reader, giving you access to all your accessibility tools — like reading mode, font customization, and highlighting.

---

## Please Note

- If you don’t see Helperbird listed, double-check that both the **Helperbird Google Docs Add-on** and **Chrome extension** are installed.  
- You might need to refresh Google Drive or Gmail after installing them for the first time.  
- Make sure you’re signed in with the same Google account used to install the add-on.
