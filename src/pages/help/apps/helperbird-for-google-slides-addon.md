Helperbird for Google Slides is a handy tool that brings all the great accessibility features you
love directly into your presentations. Unlike the main Helperbird browser extension, which works
across multiple websites, this add-on is specially designed just for Google Slides.

It makes it super easy to use tools like dyslexia-friendly fonts, text-to-speech, and more, right
within your slides.
