## How to Add the Helperbird Add-on to Google Slides

### Step 1: Open Your Presentation

Open any Google Slides presentation to get started.


---

### Step 2: Go to Extensions

Click **Extensions** in the top menu bar of Google Slides.


---

### Step 3: Install the Add-on

Select **Get Extension** from the dropdown menu. 

This opens the Google Workspace Marketplace where you can search for **Helperbird**. Click **Install** when you find it, then follow the prompts to give the necessary permissions.

Once installed, you'll find Helperbird in your Extensions menu whenever you need it.

**Tip:** You might need to sign in to your Helperbird account the first time you use it. If you're using a work or school account, check with your admin if you need approval to install extensions.

## How to Use the Translate Feature

### Step 1: Select Your Text

Highlight the text you want to translate by clicking and dragging over it on your slide.


---

### Step 2: Open Helperbird

Click **Extensions** in the top menu, then select **Helperbird** to open the sidebar.



---

### Step 3: Translate Your Text

In the Helperbird sidebar, click the **Translate** option. Choose your target language from the dropdown menu, then click **Translate** to see the translation, or **Translate & Replace** to replace the original text with the translation directly on your slide.



**Tip:** Use the regular Translate option first to check the translation before replacing your original text. This way, you can make sure it looks good before committing to the change.
