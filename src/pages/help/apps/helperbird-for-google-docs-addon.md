Helperbird for Google Docs is a handy tool that brings all the great accessibility features you love directly into your presentations. Unlike the main Helperbird browser extension, which works across multiple websites, this add-on is specially designed just for Google Docs. 

It makes it super easy to use tools like dyslexia-friendly fonts, text-to-speech, and more, right within your Docs.
