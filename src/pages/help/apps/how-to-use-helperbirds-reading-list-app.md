Helperbird's Reading List lets you save websites for later reading. Think of it as your personal bookmark collection that's always just a click away.

---

## Adding a Website to Your Reading List

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension.

---

### Step 2: Find the Add to Reading List Button

In the Quick Actions area at the top of Helperbird, you'll see an **Add to Reading list** button. This button lets you save the current webpage you're viewing.

---

### Step 3: Save the Current Page

Click the **Add to Reading list** button. You'll see a confirmation message at the bottom of your screen that says "Added to Reading List."

The current webpage is now saved to your reading list, and you can access it anytime.

**Tip:** You can add as many websites as you want to your reading list. It's perfect for saving articles, recipes, or research materials you want to read later.

---

## Viewing and Managing Your Reading List

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser's toolbar to open the extension menu.

---

### Step 2: Open Your Reading List

Look for the **Open Reading list** button in the Quick Actions area (it's the yellow button). Click it to open your reading list in a new tab.

---

### Step 3: Manage Your Saved Websites

Your reading list will open showing all the websites you've saved. Each saved page displays the website title and description, the date you saved it, a **Remove** button to delete it from your list, and a **Visit** button to open the website.

Click **Visit** to open any saved webpage, or click **Remove** to delete it from your reading list when you're done with it.

**Tip:** Your reading list syncs across all devices where you use Helperbird, so you can save something on your computer and read it later on your phone.
