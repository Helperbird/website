### Step 3: Manage Your Saved Websites

Your reading list will open showing all the websites you've saved. Each saved page displays:

- The website title and description
- The date you saved it (shown in pink)
- **Remove** button to delete it from your list
- **Visit** button to open the website

Click **Visit** to open any saved webpage, or click **Remove** to delete it from your reading list when you're done with it.
