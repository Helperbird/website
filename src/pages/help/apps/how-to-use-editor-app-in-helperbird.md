---

## Opening the Helperbird Editor

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension.



---

### Step 2: Locate the Editor Button

In the quick actions area at the top of Helperbird, find the **Open Editor** button. It's the blue icon with a pencil symbol.



---

### Step 3: Launch the Editor

Click the **Open Editor** button. The editor will open in a new tab, ready for you to start writing.

**Tip:** The editor opens in a clean, distraction-free view so you can focus on your writing without any clutter.

---

## Creating a New Document

### Step 1: Open the Helperbird Editor

If you haven't already, open the Helperbird Editor using the steps above.


---

### Step 2: Click the New Button

At the top of the editor toolbar, click the **New** button (the circular icon on the left). This creates a fresh, blank document.


---

### Step 3: Start Writing

Your new blank document is ready. Just click in the text area and start typing. The editor includes a full formatting toolbar with options for bold, italic, lists, alignment, and more.


**Tip:** Your documents are automatically saved as you work, so you don't have to worry about losing your progress.

---

## Opening Existing Documents

### Step 1: Access the Editor

Open the Helperbird Editor from your quick actions.



---

### Step 2: Click the Open Document Button

In the editor toolbar, click the **Open document** button (the folder icon next to the New button).


---

### Step 3: Select Your Document

A list of your saved documents will appear. Click on any document to open it in the editor. Your document will load with all your previous content and formatting intact.

**Tip:** You can switch between documents anytime without losing your work. Each document saves independently.

---

## Saving and Managing Documents

### Step 1: Save Your Work

After writing or editing, click the **Save** button in the toolbar (the floppy disk icon). Your document saves instantly to your Helperbird account.


---

### Step 2: Copy a Document

To duplicate a document, click the **Copy** button (the two overlapping squares icon). This creates an exact copy you can edit separately from the original.


---

### Step 3: Delete Documents

To remove a document you no longer need, click the **Delete** button (the trash icon). The document will be permanently removed from your collection.


**Tip:** Make copies of important documents before making major edits. It's an easy way to keep different versions of your work.

---

## Using Text Statistics

### Step 1: Open Text Statistics

While working on your document, click the **Text statistics** button in the toolbar (the icon with "AI" on it).


---

### Step 2: View Your Document Stats

A popup will appear showing detailed statistics about your document:

- **Words**: Total word count
- **Characters**: Total character count (including spaces)
- **Sentences**: Number of sentences
- **Reading time**: Estimated time to read (in minutes)
- **Speaking time**: Estimated time to speak aloud (in minutes)
- **Writing time**: Time spent writing (in minutes)


---

### Step 3: Use the Insights

Use these statistics to track your progress, meet word count requirements, or estimate how long your content will take to read or present.


**Tip:** Text statistics update in real-time as you write, making it easy to hit specific word count goals for essays, articles, or reports.

---

## Importing Notes

### Step 1: Click Import Notes

In the editor toolbar, click the **Import Notes** button (the chat bubble icon).


---

### Step 2: Select Your Note Source

An import dialog will appear showing available notes from your Helperbird collection or localhost. Click on the note you want to import.


---

### Step 3: View Your Imported Notes

The imported notes will appear in your document as linked references. You can click on the links to navigate between notes, making it easy to organize research or reference materials.


**Tip:** Import notes are perfect for keeping all your research in one place while working on longer writing projects.

---

## Exporting Your Documents

### Step 1: Click the Download Button

When you're ready to export your document, click the **Download** button in the toolbar (the download arrow icon).


---

### Step 2: Choose Your Export Format

A menu will appear with four export options:

- **Download to Word**: Saves as a .docx file for Microsoft Word
- **Download to Markdown**: Saves as a .md file for plain text with formatting
- **Download to Google Docs**: Creates a new document in your Google Drive
- **Download to Text file**: Saves as a .txt file with no formatting

---

### Step 3: Save Your File

Click your preferred format. The file will download to your computer (or save to Google Drive if you chose that option). You can now use your document anywhere you need it.


**Tip:** Export to Markdown if you're publishing online or to blogs. Use Word format for school assignments or professional documents. Google Docs is perfect for collaborative editing.
