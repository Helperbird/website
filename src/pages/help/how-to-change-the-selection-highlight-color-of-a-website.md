## Using the Highlight Color Feature in Helperbird

The Highlight Color feature allows you to change the color of text you highlight on web pages. This can be useful for studying, annotating, or simply marking important sections of text.

### Turning On Highlight Color

**Step 1**: Click the Helperbird icon in your browser to open the extension menu.

**Step 2**: Use the search bar at the top of the menu to search for "Highlight Color".

**Step 3**: Find the "Highlight Color" toggle and switch it to the "On" position.

### Changing the Highlight Color

**Step 4**: Once the Highlight Color feature is turned on, a palette of colors will appear below the toggle.

**Step 5**: Click on the color you wish to use for highlighting text. The selected color will be highlighted with a check mark.

**Step 6**: To test it out, simply highlight some text on the webpage. The selected color will now be used to highlight the text.

Remember to save your preferred settings if the extension allows it, so your highlight color remains consistent across browsing sessions.
