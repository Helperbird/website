If Helperbird Pro isn't working out for you, we're happy to help with a refund. Here's what you need to know.

---

## Our Refund Policy

We offer refunds within **30 days** of your initial purchase. If you're not satisfied with Helperbird Pro for any reason during this period, just reach out and we'll process your refund.

After 30 days, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. We always try to find a solution that works for you.

## How to Request a Refund

### Step 1: Contact Our Support Team

Send an email to **support@helperbird.com** with the subject line "Refund Request."

Include the following information:
- The email address associated with your Helperbird account
- Your reason for requesting a refund (optional, but helps us improve)
- The approximate date of your purchase

---

### Step 2: Wait for Confirmation

Our team will review your request and respond within 1-2 business days. We'll confirm your refund and let you know when to expect it.

---

### Step 3: Receive Your Refund

Once approved, refunds are typically processed within 5-10 business days, depending on your payment method and bank.

**Note:** Your Pro access will be deactivated once the refund is processed. You'll still have access to all Helperbird Free features.

---

## Alternative Options

Before requesting a refund, consider these alternatives:

**Having technical issues?** Our support team can often fix problems quickly. Reach out and let us troubleshoot before you cancel.

**Not using it enough?** You can cancel your subscription instead of requesting a refund. Your Pro features will remain active until the end of your billing cycle.

**Need a different plan?** If pricing is an issue, ask about our student discounts or alternative options.
