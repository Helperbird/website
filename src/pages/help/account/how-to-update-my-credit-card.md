Whether your card expired or you just got a new one, updating your payment information in Helperbird is quick and painless.

---

## Step 1: Go to the Helperbird Manage Page

Visit the [Helperbird Manage Page](https://payments.coffeeandfun.com/p/login/cN214adE29toci4bII) and enter the email address linked to your Helperbird account.

---

## Step 2: Verify Your Email

Check your inbox for a verification code (it's good for 10 minutes). Enter the code in the verification box and click **Verify**. You'll be taken straight to your Helperbird dashboard.

---

## Step 3: Update Your Payment Method

In your dashboard, click the **Add payment method** button. Enter your new credit card details and click **Save**. Your payment information is now updated and ready to go.

**Tip:** If you're updating because your card is about to expire, do it a few days early to avoid any interruption in your subscription. Your next billing cycle will automatically use the new card.
