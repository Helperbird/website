Whether your card expired or you just got a new one, updating your payment information in Helperbird is quick and painless.

## Step 2: Verify Your Email

Check your inbox for a verification code (it's good for 10 minutes). Enter the code in the verification box and click **Verify**. You'll be taken straight to your Helperbird dashboard.

*Tip:* If you're updating because your card is about to expire, do it a few days early to avoid any interruption in your subscription. Your next billing cycle will automatically use the new card.
