Your Helperbird subscription key unlocks all your Pro features. You'll find it in the second email we sent after you signed up. If you can't locate it, no worries—our support team can help you track it down.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension. You'll see your quick actions and main features displayed.


---

## Step 2: Go to Settings and Login

Scroll to the bottom of the Helperbird app and click the **Settings** cog icon. In the menu that appears, click the **Login** button. This will open a new tab where you can manage your subscription.


---

## Step 3: Enter Your Subscription Key

Scroll down to the subscription section on the new tab. Enter your subscription key in the field provided and click **Save**. 

If your key is valid, you'll see confetti and a confirmation message—you're all set! 

If no subscription is detected, you'll see a message letting you know, and you can reach out to support for help.


*Tip:* Can't find your subscription key email? Check your spam folder first. If it's still missing, you can also log in using your email address instead—just click the email login option on the same page.
