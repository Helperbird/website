Whether you're switching to a new email address or just want to update your account, changing your email in Helperbird is quick and easy.

---

## Step 1: Go to the Helperbird Manage Page

Head to the [Helperbird Manage Page](https://payments.coffeeandfun.com/p/login/cN214adE29toci4bII) and enter your current email address. Click the **Login** button to continue.


---

## Step 2: Verify Your Email

Check your inbox for a verification code (it's valid for 10 minutes). Enter the code in the verification box and click **Verify**. You'll then be taken to your Helperbird dashboard.



---

## Step 3: Update Your Email Address

In your dashboard, click on **Update information**. Enter your new email address in the field provided and click **Save**. That's it! Your email is now updated, and you'll receive a confirmation email at your new address.


*Tip:* Make sure you have access to your new email address before updating, as you'll need to verify it for future logins. You'll receive a confirmation email at both your old and new addresses.
