## Step 1: Go to the Helperbird Manage Page

Head to the [Helperbird Manage Page](https://payments.coffeeandfun.com/p/login/cN214adE29toci4bII) and enter the email address associated with your Helperbird account. 

Click the **Login** button to continue.

Check your inbox for a verification code (it's valid for 10 minutes). Enter the code in the verification box and click **Verify**.

You'll then be taken to your Helperbird dashboard.

## Step 3: Manage Your Subscription

Once you're in your dashboard, you can manage everything related to your subscription:

- **View subscription details**: See your current plan, billing cycle, and next payment date
- **Update payment method**: Add or change your credit card information
- **Update email address**: Change the email associated with your account
- **Cancel subscription**: Click the **Cancel subscription** button and confirm to cancel your plan (your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle)


*Tip:* If you're canceling because you're experiencing issues with Helperbird, reach out to our support team first. We're happy to help troubleshoot and might be able to solve the problem so you can keep using Pro features.
