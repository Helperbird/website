If you've decided Helperbird Pro isn't the right fit for you right now, that's totally okay. Canceling your subscription is straightforward, and we'll walk you through it.

---

## Step 1: Go to the Helperbird Manage Page

Head over to the [Helperbird Manage Page](https://payments.coffeeandfun.com/p/login/cN214adE29toci4bII) and enter the email address you used when you signed up for Helperbird Pro.

## Step 2: Verify Your Email

Check your inbox for a verification code (it should arrive within a minute or two). The code is valid for 10 minutes, so grab it while it's fresh. Enter the code on the verification page and click **Verify** to access your dashboard.

## Step 3: Cancel Your Subscription

Once you're in your dashboard, look for the **Cancel plan** button and click it. Confirm your cancellation, and you're all set. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle, so you'll still have access to all Pro features until then.

*Tip:* Your cancellation takes effect at the end of your billing cycle, so you can keep using Helperbird Pro until then. If you change your mind, you can always resubscribe later!
