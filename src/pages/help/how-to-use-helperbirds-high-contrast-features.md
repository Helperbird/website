## Activating High Contrast Modes

**Step 1**: Click on the Helperbird extension icon in your browser to open the Helperbird menu.

**Step 2**: Use the search bar to find 'High contrast' or scroll down to the 'Display options' section.

**Step 3**: Toggle the 'High contrast' switch to the 'On' position to activate the feature.

## Setting High Contrast Styles

### For Increased Contrast
**Step 1**: With 'High contrast' activated, click on the 'Increased contrast' option to enhance the contrast on the page.

### For Greyscale
**Step 1**: Click on the 'Greyscale' option to change all page colors to shades of grey, reducing visual stress and distraction.

### For Inverted Colors
**Step 1**: Select the 'Inverted colors' option to invert the colors on the page, which can help reduce glare and improve readability for some users.

### For Inverted Greyscale
**Step 1**: Choose the 'Inverted greyscale' to invert the greyscale colors, offering a high-contrast visual that some users may find easier to read.

### For Yellow on Black
**Step 1**: Click on the 'Yellow on black' option for a specific high-contrast theme with yellow text on a black background, often preferred by users with certain types of visual impairment.

After selecting any of the above options, the web page will immediately reflect the new high contrast style, helping to improve visibility and reduce eye strain.



## What is high contrast?

A high contrast theme or high contrast mode uses a limited color palette with contrasting colors to make an interface easier to use. 

This is different than using an inverted display, though often times the high contrast mode looks similar to an inverted display because of the darker color scheme.
