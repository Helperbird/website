Sometimes you need a break from your customizations. Pausing Helperbird turns off all features temporarily without losing any of your settings.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Find the On/Off Toggle

At the top of the Helperbird panel, you'll see a toggle button that says either **Helperbird is on** or **Helperbird is off**.

---

## Step 3: Pause or Resume Helperbird

Click the toggle to turn Helperbird off or back on:
- **To pause**: Click the toggle when it says "Helperbird is on"—it will switch to "Helperbird is off"
- **To resume**: Click the toggle when it says "Helperbird is off"—it will switch back to "Helperbird is on"

**Tip:** Pausing Helperbird is perfect when you need to see a website in its original format or want to take screenshots without customizations.
