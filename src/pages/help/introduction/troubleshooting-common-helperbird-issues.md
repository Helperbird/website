Having trouble with Helperbird? Here are solutions to the most common issues users encounter.

---

## Helperbird Not Appearing

If you can't see the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar:

**Check if it's pinned**
The extension might be installed but hidden. Click the puzzle piece icon (Chrome/Edge) or the extensions menu to find Helperbird and pin it to your toolbar. [Learn how to pin Helperbird](/help/how-to-pin-a-chrome-extension/).

**Check if it's enabled**
Go to your browser's extensions page and make sure Helperbird is turned on.

**Reinstall the extension**
Sometimes a fresh install helps. Remove Helperbird, restart your browser, and reinstall from the store.

---

## Features Not Working

If Helperbird features aren't working on a page:

**Check if Helperbird is turned on**
Open Helperbird and make sure the toggle at the top says "Helperbird is on". [Learn how to turn Helperbird on](/help/how-to-turn-helperbird-on/).

**Refresh the page**
Some features need a page refresh to activate. Try reloading the page after enabling a feature.

**Check the page type**
Helperbird doesn't work on certain pages like browser settings pages, the Chrome Web Store, or some internal pages. This is a browser security restriction.

**Check for Pro features**
If you're trying to use a Pro feature, make sure you're logged in with an active subscription.

---

## Login Issues

If you can't log in or your Pro features aren't appearing:

**Check your email**
Make sure you're using the same email address you used when you signed up for Helperbird Pro.

**Enable browser sync (Chrome/Edge)**
Email login requires browser sync to be enabled. [Learn how to enable browser sync](/help/enable-browser-sync-chrome-and-edge/).

**Try a subscription key**
If email login isn't working, use your subscription key instead. You can find it in your welcome email or request it from support.

**Clear and re-enter**
Try logging out, clearing the subscription key field, and entering it again.

---

## Extension Crashing

If Helperbird keeps crashing or freezing:

**Update your browser**
Make sure you're running the latest version of your browser.

**Update Helperbird**
Check that you have the latest version of Helperbird installed.

**Disable other extensions**
Sometimes other extensions conflict with Helperbird. Try disabling other extensions temporarily to see if that fixes the issue.

**Clear browser cache**
Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can resolve unexpected behavior.

**Reinstall**
As a last resort, remove Helperbird completely and reinstall it fresh from the extension store.

---

## Text to Speech Not Working

If Text to Speech isn't reading aloud:

**Check your volume**
Make sure your device volume is turned up and not muted.

**Check browser permissions**
Your browser might be blocking audio. Look for a speaker icon in the address bar and make sure audio is allowed.

**Select text first**
Some Text to Speech modes require you to select text before clicking play.

---

## Changes Not Saving

If your settings aren't saving between sessions:

**Check browser sync**
If you're on Chrome or Edge, enable browser sync to save your settings.

**Check private/incognito mode**
Settings may not save in private browsing mode.

**Try a different browser profile**
If you're using a managed or guest profile, try using a regular browser profile instead.
