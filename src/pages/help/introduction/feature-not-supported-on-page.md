If you're seeing a **Feature Not Supported** message, don't worry—you didn't do anything wrong. Some websites are built in a way that makes it hard for Helperbird to work its magic. 

Here's what's happening and what we're doing about it.

---

## Why This Happens

Some sites like Google Docs don't use regular HTML text. Instead, they use something called canvas rendering, which basically draws text like an image rather than displaying it as actual text. 

When text is rendered this way, Helperbird can't modify it the same way it does on regular websites. Features like font changes, text spacing, or line height adjustments won't work on these pages because the text isn't accessible in the usual way.


---

## What We're Doing About It

We're actively working on solutions to make Helperbird work on more sites, including those that use canvas rendering.

 Our team is constantly improving the extension to expand compatibility. We know how important it is for Helperbird to work everywhere you need it, and we're committed to getting there.

## How You Can Help

Your feedback is incredibly valuable. 

If you run into a site where Helperbird doesn't work, let us know through our [feedback page](/feedback/). 

Tell us which site you were on and which feature you were trying to use. This helps us prioritize what to work on next and makes Helperbird better for everyone.

**Tip:** In the meantime, try using Helperbird's features on other tabs while you work on canvas-based sites. Many users keep a separate tab open for reading or research where Helperbird works perfectly!
