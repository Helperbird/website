Quick Actions puts your most-used Helperbird features right at your fingertips. Instead of searching through menus, you can access everything you need in one spot. 

Here's how to customize it.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser. The Helperbird menu will open, showing your current Quick Actions at the top with icon boxes.



---

## Step 2: Add Your Favorite Features

Look for the **plus sign (+)** near the top of Helperbird within the icon boxes and click it. 

A list of all available features will appear. Browse through and click the **heart icon** next to any feature you want to add to Quick Actions. 

The feature will instantly appear in your Quick Actions area.



---

## Step 3: Remove Features You Don't Need

If you want to remove a feature from Quick Actions, click the **plus sign (+)** again. 

Find the feature you want to remove in the list and click the **heart icon** to deselect it. The feature will disappear from your Quick Actions area right away.


**Tip:** Add the features you use every single day to Quick Actions. This saves you time and makes Helperbird feel like it was built just for you!
