Helperbird Pro Unlimited is built for schools, districts, and businesses that want to give everyone access to Helperbird Pro. Instead of paying per user, you pay one price and everyone in your organization gets full access. It's simple and cost-effective.

---

## What's Included?

You get everything from Helperbird Pro, but for unlimited users within your organization. Everyone with an email address from your domain can use all the Pro features. No per-seat pricing, no user limits.

**Pricing:** $1,500 per year or $129.99 per month.

---

## What's a Domain?

A domain is the part of your email address after the @ symbol. For example, if your email is **user@helperbird.com**, your domain is **helperbird.com**. With Pro Unlimited, anyone with an email ending in your domain gets access. People outside your domain won't have access.

**Example:** If your school's domain is **@yourschool.edu**, every student and staff member with a **@yourschool.edu** email can use Helperbird Pro.
