There are two ways to log in to Helperbird and unlock your Pro features. You can use your email or a subscription key. Pick whichever method works best for you.

---

## Log in with Email

**Works on Chrome and Edge**  
Make sure [browser sync is enabled](/help/enable-browser-sync-chrome-and-edge/) before you start.

### Step 1: Open Helperbird Settings

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser. Scroll down to the bottom of the menu and click **Settings**. This will open a new tab with your Helperbird settings.

### Step 2: Click Login and Grant Permission

In the settings tab, find the account card and click **Login**. You'll be asked to allow Helperbird to read your email address. 

Click to grant permission so Helperbird can check if you have an active Pro subscription.


---

### Step 3: Access Your Pro Features

Helperbird will check your email for an active subscription. 

If you have one, you'll instantly get access to all Pro features. If you don't have a subscription or run into issues, you can use a [subscription key](/help/how-to-use-my-subscription-key/) instead.


**Tip:** Email login is the easiest method if you're on Chrome or Edge. Your login will sync across all your devices automatically!

---

## Log in with Subscription Key

**Works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, iPhone, and iPad**  
[Learn more about subscription keys](/help/how-to-use-my-subscription-key/).

### Step 1: Open Helperbird Settings

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Settings**. A new tab will open with all your Helperbird settings.



---

### Step 2: Find the Subscription Section

In the settings tab, scroll down until you see the subscription section. 

This is where you'll enter your subscription key.


---

### Step 3: Enter Your Key and Save

Type or paste your subscription key into the field and click **Save**. If the key is valid and you have an active subscription, you'll see confetti and a confirmation message. 

You now have access to all Pro features!


**Tip:** Keep your subscription key somewhere safe. You'll need it if you switch browsers or devices, or if you use Firefox, iPhone, or iPad!
