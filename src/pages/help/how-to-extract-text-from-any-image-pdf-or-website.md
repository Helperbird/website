## Using the Extract Text (OCR) Feature in Helperbird

Helperbird's OCR feature allows you to extract text from images, PDFs, and web pages into selectable and readable text.

### Steps to Extract Text

**Step 1**: Open Helperbird by clicking the icon in your browser.

**Step 2**: Use the search bar to find the 'Extract Text' feature.

**Step 3**: Click 'Start' to initiate the OCR process.

**Step 4**: Drag to select the area on the page you wish to extract text from. Helperbird will then process the text.

### Reading Extracted Text

After text has been extracted, you have the option to have it read aloud immediately.

**Step 1**: Toggle 'Read extracted' on if you wish for the text to be read aloud after extraction.

**Step 2**: Once extraction is complete, if 'Read extracted' is toggled on, the text will be read aloud to you.

### Saving Extracted Text

The extracted text will automatically be saved to your clipboard.

**Step 1**: Ensure 'Save extracted' is toggled on to save the text.

**Step 2**: After extraction, the text will be saved to your clipboard for easy pasting and use elsewhere.
