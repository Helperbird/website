## Desktop-Only Features

Some features are only available on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox due to iOS Safari limitations:

**Voice Typing** - Speech-to-text input is not available on iOS Safari extensions.

**Word Prediction** - Typing predictions only work on desktop browsers.

**Screenshot Tools** - Browser screenshot capture is desktop-only.

**Extract Text from Images (OCR)** - Image text extraction is limited on iOS.

**Auto Scroll** - Automatic page scrolling is a desktop feature.

**Cursor Customization** - Custom cursor options are not available on iOS.

**Some Keyboard Shortcuts** - Desktop has more keyboard shortcut options.

## iOS-Specific Notes

**Accessing Helperbird**
On iOS, you access Helperbird through the Safari extension menu (tap the aA button or puzzle icon). On desktop, you click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar.

**Performance**
Some features may run slightly differently on iOS due to Safari's extension architecture. If you notice any issues, try refreshing the page.

**Settings Sync**
Your Helperbird settings sync across devices when you're logged in with the same account. Changes made on desktop will appear on iOS and vice versa.

**Pro Features**
Your Helperbird Pro subscription works on all platforms. Log in with the same account to access Pro features everywhere.

## Why Are Some Features Desktop-Only?

Apple's Safari extension system has different capabilities than Chrome, Edge, and Firefox extensions. Some features require APIs that aren't available on iOS, which is why they're limited to desktop browsers.

We're always working to bring more features to iOS as Apple expands what Safari extensions can do.
