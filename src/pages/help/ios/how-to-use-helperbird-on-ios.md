Once you've installed and enabled Helperbird, here's how to use it while browsing on your iPhone or iPad.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird in Safari

Open **Safari** and go to any website. Tap the **aA** button in the address bar (on iPhone) or the **puzzle piece icon** (on iPad). Tap **Helperbird** from the menu to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Turn Helperbird On

When Helperbird opens, make sure the main toggle at the top is turned **on**. When enabled, the toggle will be green and say "Helperbird is on."

---

## Step 3: Use Helperbird Features

Browse through the available features in the Helperbird menu. Some popular features include:

**Text to Speech** - Have any text read aloud to you.

**Dyslexia Fonts** - Switch to fonts designed for easier reading.

**Reading Mode** - Strip away distractions and focus on the content.

**Immersive Reader** - Use Microsoft's reading tool for a focused experience.

**Overlays** - Add a colored overlay to reduce eye strain.

Tap on any feature to enable it. Most features have a toggle that turns green when active.

---

## Step 4: Customize Your Settings

Many features have additional options you can customize. Tap on a feature to expand its settings. Adjust colors, sizes, speeds, and other options to match your preferences.

Your settings are saved automatically and will apply the next time you use Helperbird.

---

## Step 5: Use the Helperbird App

You can also open the **Helperbird app** directly from your home screen. The app gives you access to additional tools like the Document Editor and Reading List that work independently of Safari.

**Tip:** Add frequently used websites to your Reading List in Helperbird to access them quickly with your preferred settings already applied.
