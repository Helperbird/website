Setting up Helperbird for your child using Family Sharing is straightforward. You'll need to temporarily turn off Screen Time restrictions, install the app, and then turn those restrictions back on. Here's how to do it.

---

## Step 1: Turn off Screen Time Restrictions

Open the **Settings** app on your child's iOS device. Scroll down and tap **Screen Time**. If you've set a Screen Time Passcode, enter it now. Tap **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, then toggle the switch to turn it **off**. This temporarily removes restrictions so you can install Helperbird.

## Step 2: Download and Install Helperbird

Open the **App Store** on your child's device and tap the search icon at the bottom. Type "Helperbird" in the search bar and tap **Search**. Find the Helperbird app (look for the blue bird icon) and tap **Get**. You may need to enter your Apple ID password or use Touch ID/Face ID to confirm the download. Wait for the app to finish installing.

## Step 3: Enable Helperbird and Restore Screen Time

Once installed, go back to the **Settings** app and scroll down to find **Helperbird**. Tap on it and make sure all options under **Allow Helperbird to Access** are toggled on. Now it's time to turn Screen Time back on. Go to **Settings > Screen Time**, enter your passcode, then tap **Content & Privacy Restrictions** and toggle the switch back **on**. Your child can now use Helperbird with your Screen Time settings restored.

**Tip:** Make sure to test Helperbird with your child after setup to ensure all features are working properly while Screen Time is active!
