## Using the Line Focus Feature in Helperbird

The Line Focus feature in Helperbird enhances reading focus by highlighting the line you're reading while dimming the rest of the page. It's an excellent tool for individuals with dyslexia or anyone looking to concentrate better on the text.

**Step 1**: Open the Helperbird extension menu by clicking its icon in your browser's toolbar.

**Step 2**: In the menu, use the search function to find the 'Line Focus' feature.

**Step 3**: Enable Line Focus by toggling the switch to the 'On' position.

**Step 4**: A transparent line aligned with your mouse cursor will appear, allowing you to focus on the current line while the rest of the page is shaded.

## Customizing the Height of the Line Focus

**Step 1**: Make sure Line Focus is active and open its settings by clicking 'Settings'.

**Step 2**: Locate the 'Height' slider in the settings panel.

**Step 3**: Adjust the slider to modify the height of the transparent focus line to your preference.

## Customizing the Width of the Line Focus

**Step 1**: With Line Focus turned on, access the 'Settings' panel.

**Step 2**: Find the 'Width' slider.

**Step 3**: Move the slider to determine the width of the focus line, tailoring it to the size of the text you're reading.

## Changing the Color of the Line Focus Overlay

**Step 1**: Ensure Line Focus is turned on and go into its settings.

**Step 2**: In the 'Color' options, click on one of the colored circles.

**Step 3**: Choose a color for the overlay that comfortably contrasts with the text and background for optimal focus.


## Controlling the Brightness of the Line Focus Tint/Overlay

Adjusting the brightness of the Line Focus tint or overlay can make reading more comfortable, especially in various lighting conditions or for extended periods.

**Step 1**: Activate the Line Focus by following the initial steps to enable the feature.

**Step 2**: Once Line Focus is enabled, open the 'Settings' for more customization options.

**Step 3**: Look for the 'Brightness' slider within the settings.

**Step 4**: Slide to the left to decrease the brightness and make the overlay darker, or slide to the right to increase the brightness for a lighter overlay.
