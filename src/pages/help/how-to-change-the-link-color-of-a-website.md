## Customizing Link Colors in Helperbird

Helperbird allows you to change the color of links on web pages, enhancing visibility for those with visual impairments or personal color preferences. You can set different colors for unvisited and visited links.

### Changing the Color of Unvisited Links

**Step 1**: Click the Helperbird icon to open the extension menu.

**Step 2**: Use the search function to locate 'Link color'.

**Step 3**: Toggle the 'Links' switch on to activate the link color customization feature.

**Step 4**: Below the toggle, you'll see a palette of colors. Click on the color circle you want to apply to unvisited links.

### Changing the Color of Visited Links

**Step 1**: With the 'Link color' feature active, scroll down to the 'Visited' section.

**Step 2**: Similar to unvisited links, select a color from the palette for visited links.

**Step 3**: The color you click will immediately apply to all visited links on the current web page.
