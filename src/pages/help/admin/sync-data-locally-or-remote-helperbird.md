## Managing Helperbird Settings: Sync vs. Local

With Helperbird, you have the flexibility to synchronize your settings across multiple devices or
keep them local to one device. Hereâ€™s how to manage these settings:

### Accessing Settings

**Step 1**: Click the Helperbird icon in your browser to open the extension.

**Step 2**: Navigate to the settings by clicking the gear icon in the top corner of the Helperbird
menu.

### Enabling Sync

**Step 3**: Scroll to 'Helperbird Settings' within the settings menu.

**Step 4**: Find the toggle for 'Sync Helperbird' to manage synchronization.

**Step 5**: Toggle it on to enable syncing across all your devices where you are logged in with the
same Helperbird account.

### Sync vs. Local: Understanding the Difference

- **Sync**: By enabling sync, you ensure that all your preferred Helperbird settings are consistent
  across every device you use. This means that any changes you make in one place will automatically
  update across all others.

- **Local**: If you prefer to have different settings on different devices or if you use a
  public/shared computer, keeping your data local might be the better option. With local settings,
  changes made on one device will not affect the settings on another.

**Step 6**: Decide between sync or local based on your needs and toggle the 'Sync Helperbird' switch
accordingly.

### Confirming Your Choice

**Step 7**: Once you've made your choice, your settings will be applied as selected. If you've
chosen to sync, give it a moment to update across your devices.

Remember, you can change between sync and local at any time by revisiting the Helperbird settings.
