Helperbird gives you the flexibility to sync your settings across all your devices or keep them local to just one device. This guide shows you how to choose the option that works best for you.

**Before you start:** Make sure you're signed into Helperbird on the devices where you want to sync settings.

---

## Understanding Sync vs Local

**Sync Settings**
When you enable sync, your Helperbird preferences stay consistent across every device where you're logged in. Any changes you make on one device automatically update everywhere else. Perfect for people who use multiple devices regularly.

**Local Settings**
When you keep settings local, changes only affect the current device. This is ideal if you use different settings on different devices, or if you're on a shared or public computer.

**You can switch between sync and local anytime** by toggling the setting in Helperbird.

---

## Enabling Sync

### Step 1: Open Helperbird Settings

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser, then click the gear icon in the top corner to open settings.

---

### Step 2: Find Sync Settings

Scroll down to the **Helperbird Settings** section. Look for the **Sync Helperbird** toggle.

---

### Step 3: Turn On Sync

Toggle **Sync Helperbird** to the on position. Your settings will now sync across all devices where you're logged into Helperbird with the same account.

**Tip:** After enabling sync, give it a moment to update across your devices. You might need to refresh Helperbird on other devices to see the changes.

## Keeping Settings Local

### Step 1: Open Helperbird Settings

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser, then click the gear icon to open settings.

---

### Step 2: Find Sync Settings

Scroll down to the **Helperbird Settings** section and locate the **Sync Helperbird** toggle.

---

### Step 3: Turn Off Sync

Toggle **Sync Helperbird** to the off position. Your settings will now stay local to this device only. Changes won't affect your other devices.

**Tip:** Local settings are great for shared computers or when you need different configurations on different devices (like using different fonts at work vs. home).
