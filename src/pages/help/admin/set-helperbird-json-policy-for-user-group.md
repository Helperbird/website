This guide shows you how to apply Helperbird's JSON policy for a specific user group in your Google Workspace. This is perfect for phased rollouts, pilot programs, or giving Helperbird features to select teams.

**Before you start:** You'll need administrator access to the Google Admin Console and Helperbird's extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**

## Adding Helperbird for the Group

### Step 1: Access Group Settings

Log into **admin.google.com** and go to **Devices** → **Chrome** → **Apps & extensions** → **Users & browsers**. In the left panel, select the specific user group you want to configure (not an organizational unit or individual user).

---

### Step 2: Add Helperbird

If Helperbird isn't already listed for this group, click **+** and select **Add from Chrome Web Store**. Search for Helperbird or paste the extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**

---

### Step 3: Set Installation Policy

Set the **Installation policy** to **Force install** (recommended) so the extension installs automatically for all users in this group. Click **Save**, then click on the Helperbird tile to open its settings.

**Tip:** User groups let you target specific teams without affecting your entire organization. This is great for testing or gradual rollouts.

---

## Applying the JSON Policy

### Step 1: Open the Policy Editor

In the Helperbird settings panel, find the **Policy for extensions** section (it might also be called "Additional settings" or "Extension settings"). Click **Edit** or **Add** to open the JSON editor.

---

### Step 2: Paste the JSON Policy

Copy and paste this JSON, replacing `YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY` with the actual subscription key for this group:

```json
{
  "subKey": {
    "Value": "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY"
  },
  "isAdminControl": {
    "Value": true
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Save Your Changes

Click **Save** in the JSON editor, then click **Save** again at the top right to confirm all changes for this group.

**Tip:** Set `"isAdminControl": true` only if everyone in this group needs admin-level controls in Helperbird. Most groups should have this set to `false`.

---

## Verifying and Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Check on a Group Member's Device

Have someone from the group sign into their managed Chrome browser. Helperbird should be installed automatically (check Chrome menu → **Extensions**).

---

### Step 2: Test the Settings

Ask a group member to open Helperbird and confirm that features tied to their subscription key are unlocked and working correctly.

---

### Step 3: Force a Policy Refresh if Needed

If the settings don't appear right away:
- **On Windows/Mac/Linux**: Restart Chrome or go to `chrome://policy` and click **Reload policies**
- **On ChromeOS**: Sign out and sign back in, or restart the device

**Common issues:**
- **Wrong target**: Double-check you applied settings at the user group level, not an organizational unit
- **JSON formatting errors**: Make sure all braces, quotes, and commas are correct
- **Policy conflicts**: User group policies override OU policies, so check for conflicts
- **Wait a few minutes**: Policies can take a few minutes to propagate
