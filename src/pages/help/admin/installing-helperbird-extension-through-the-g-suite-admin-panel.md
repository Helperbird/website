This guide walks G Suite administrators through deploying Helperbird to all Chrome users in your organization. Once deployed, Helperbird will automatically install for everyone in your selected organizational unit.

**Before you start:** You'll need administrator access to the Google Admin Console and Helperbird's extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**

---

## Deploying Helperbird

### Step 1: Access Chrome Management

Log into your Google Admin Console at **admin.google.com**. Navigate to **Devices** > **Chrome** > **Apps & Extensions**.

---

### Step 2: Add the Helperbird Extension

Select the Organizational Unit where you want to deploy Helperbird. Click the **+** icon, select **Add from Chrome Web Store**, and enter Helperbird's extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**

---

### Step 3: Configure and Deploy

Set the installation policy to **Force Install** (this prevents users from uninstalling it). Click **Save** to deploy the extension to all users in your selected organizational unit.

**Tip:** Test with a small group first by creating a test organizational unit before rolling out to your entire organization.

---

## Verifying the Installation

### Step 1: Log in as a User

Log into Chrome with a user account from your selected Organizational Unit.

---

### Step 2: Check for Helperbird

Helperbird should automatically appear in the extensions toolbar in the top-right corner of Chrome.

---

### Step 3: Test Functionality

Click the Helperbird icon to confirm it opens correctly and all features are accessible.

**Tip:** Changes can take up to 15 minutes to propagate. If a user doesn't see Helperbird immediately, have them restart Chrome or wait a bit longer.
