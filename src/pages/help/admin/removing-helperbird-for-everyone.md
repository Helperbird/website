This guide shows G Suite administrators how to remove the Helperbird extension for all users in an organizational unit. This will uninstall Helperbird from everyone's browser in the selected group.

## Removing Helperbird for All Users

### Step 1: Access Chrome Management

Log into your Google Admin Console at **admin.google.com**. Navigate to **Devices** > **Chrome** > **Apps & Extensions**.

---

### Step 2: Find the Helperbird Extension

Select the Organizational Unit where Helperbird is installed. Look for Helperbird in your list of Apps & Extensions (Extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**).

---

### Step 3: Remove the Extension

Click the trash bin icon next to the Helperbird extension. Confirm the deletion by clicking **Remove**.

Helperbird will be uninstalled from all users' browsers in the selected organizational unit.

**Tip:** Let your users know before removing Helperbird, especially if they rely on it for accessibility. Consider moving it to "Allow install" instead of removing it completely, so users who need it can reinstall it themselves.
