This guide walks administrators through deploying Helperbird across your organization, whether you're using Google Chrome with G Suite or Microsoft Edge with Microsoft 365. Follow these steps to make Helperbird available to all your users automatically.

**Before you start:** You'll need administrator access to either the Google Admin Console or Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

## Deploying on Google Chrome

### Step 1: Access Chrome Management

Log into your Google Admin Console at **admin.google.com**. Navigate to **Devices** > **Chrome** > **Apps & Extensions**.

---

### Step 2: Add the Helperbird Extension

Select the Organizational Unit where you want to deploy Helperbird. Click the **+** icon, select **Add from Chrome Web Store**, and enter Helperbird's extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**

---

### Step 3: Configure and Deploy

Set the installation policy to **Force Install** (or your preferred setting). Click **Save** to deploy the extension to all users in your selected organizational unit.

**Tip:** If you want to test first, deploy to a small test group before rolling out to your entire organization.

---

## Deploying on Microsoft Edge

### Step 1: Access Edge Management

Log into the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Navigate to **Settings** > **Services & Add-ins** > **Microsoft Edge Management**.

---

### Step 2: Add the Helperbird Extension

Under **Manage Extensions**, add Helperbird's extension ID: **bkibfggdahioahpokehoiimdmdjefjmd**

---

### Step 3: Configure and Save

Specify your deployment options (such as force install), then click **Save** to apply the configuration changes.

**Tip:** Make sure to select the appropriate deployment scope for your organization's needs.

---

## Verifying the Deployment

### Step 1: Test on Chrome

Log into a user account within your Organizational Unit and open Chrome. Helperbird should be automatically installed in the extensions toolbar.

---

### Step 2: Test on Edge

Log into a user account and open Microsoft Edge. Check that Helperbird appears in the extensions toolbar.

---

### Step 3: Confirm Functionality

Click on the Helperbird icon to ensure it opens correctly and all features are accessible to your users.

**Tip:** Changes can take up to 15 minutes to propagate. If users don't see Helperbird immediately, have them restart their browser or wait a bit longer.
