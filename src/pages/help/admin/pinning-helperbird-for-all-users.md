This guide shows G Suite administrators how to force pin the Helperbird extension to the browser toolbar for all users in an organizational unit. Pinning ensures the extension is always visible and easy to access, so users don't have to search for it in their extensions menu.

**Before you start:** You'll need administrator access to the Google Admin Console and Helperbird should already be installed in your organization.

## Pinning Helperbird for All Users

### Step 1: Access Chrome Management

Log into your Google Admin Console at **admin.google.com**. Navigate to **Devices** > **Chrome** > **Apps & Extensions**.

---

### Step 2: Configure the Extension

Select the Organizational Unit where you want to pin Helperbird. 

If Helperbird isn't already added, click the **+** button and enter Helperbird's extension ID: **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**

---

### Step 3: Set Pin to Toolbar

In the extension settings, find the **Pin to taskbar** dropdown and select **Pin**. 

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

The Helperbird icon will now appear pinned to the browser toolbar for all users in your selected organizational unit.

**Tip:** Pinning the extension makes it much easier for users to find and use Helperbird. They'll see the icon right in their toolbar instead of having to click through their extensions menu.
