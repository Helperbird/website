## Why Helperbird Uses Sync

Helperbird uses the built-in sync feature in Chrome and Edge to access the email address you’re
signed in with within the browser.

This allows Helperbird to personalize your experience and ensure that your settings and preferences
are consistent across all your devices.

### Privacy Note

We do not collect any of your information when you enable sync. Your data remains secure and
private.
