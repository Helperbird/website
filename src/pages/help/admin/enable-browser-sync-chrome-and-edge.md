## How to Turn On Sync in Chrome or Edge

### Step 1: Open Browser Settings

Click the three dots in the upper-right corner of Chrome or Edge, then select **Settings** from the menu.

---

### Step 2: Enable Sync

Scroll down to **Sync and Google Services** (Chrome) or **Sync and Microsoft Services** (Edge). Toggle the switch next to **Sync** to turn it on. If prompted, sign in to your Google or Microsoft account.

---

### Step 3: Customize What Syncs

Click **Advanced Sync Settings** to choose what data you want to sync, such as bookmarks, passwords, and extensions. 

Click **Save** when you're done.

You'll see **Sync is on** in your settings, confirming that sync is enabled.

**Tip:** For Edge users, these steps apply to Chromium-based Edge. If you're using an older version of Edge, the steps may differ slightly.
