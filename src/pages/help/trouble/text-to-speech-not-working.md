If Text to Speech isn't working in Helperbird, here are the most common fixes.

---

## Step 1: Check Your Volume

Make sure your device volume is turned up and not muted. This sounds obvious, but it's the most common cause. Check both your system volume and any in-app volume controls.

On desktop, also check that your browser tab isn't muted. Look for a speaker icon in the tab—if it has a line through it, right-click the tab and select "Unmute."

---

## Step 2: Check Browser Permissions

Your browser might be blocking audio from playing.

**Chrome/Edge:** Look for a speaker or blocked icon in the address bar. Click it and allow audio for the site.

**Firefox:** Check the permissions icon (usually a lock) in the address bar and ensure autoplay is allowed.

**Safari:** Go to Safari > Settings > Websites > Auto-Play and make sure it's set to allow audio.

## Step 3: Try a Different Voice

Sometimes a specific voice fails to load. Open Helperbird, go to Text to Speech settings, and try selecting a different voice. If another voice works, the original voice may have a temporary issue.

---

## Step 4: Select Text First

Some Text to Speech modes require you to select text before clicking play. Try highlighting the text you want read, then click the play button.

---

## Step 5: Refresh the Page

Text to Speech can sometimes stop working if a page has been open for a long time. Refresh the page and try again.

---

## Step 6: Check Your Internet Connection

Some premium voices require an internet connection to work. Make sure you're connected to the internet and try again.

---

## Step 7: Restart Your Browser

If nothing else works, close your browser completely and reopen it. This clears any temporary issues that might be blocking audio.

---

## Step 8: Update Helperbird

Make sure you're running the latest version of Helperbird. Updates often fix audio-related bugs. Check your browser's extension page for updates.
