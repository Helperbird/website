## Why Helperbird (and Other Extensions) Don't Work on Certain Pages

### Understanding the Limitations

You might have noticed that Helperbird or other browser extensions don't work on certain pages, like
**chrome://extensions/** or other internal pages of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. This isn't a
bug with Helperbird—it's a security and technical limitation built into the browsers themselves.

### What Are Internal Pages?

Internal pages are special pages within the browser that give you access to settings,
configurations, and other tools that control the browser’s behavior.

These pages often include:

#### Chrome’s extensions management page

**chrome://extensions/**

#### Firefox’s add-ons management page

**about:addons**

#### Edge’s extensions management page

**edge://extensions/**

#### Safari’s settings pages

**about://preferences**

#### Chrome’s main settings page

**chrome://settings/**

#### Firefox’s advanced configuration page

**about:config**

### Why Extensions Don't Work on These Pages

#### Security Reasons

Browsers restrict extensions from running on internal pages to protect the browser's core
functionality. Allowing extensions to interact with these sensitive pages could create security
risks, such as modifying or disrupting the browser’s operation, accessing private settings, or
potentially causing conflicts that could make the browser unstable.

#### Technical Limitations

Internal pages are designed to interact directly with the browser’s engine and operate outside the
scope of normal web pages. They are part of the browser’s core functionality and don't operate like
standard websites that extensions can modify. Because of this, extensions don't have the necessary
permissions or access to change or interact with the content on these pages.

### Examples of Pages Where Extensions Don’t Work

Here are some common examples of pages where you might find that Helperbird or other extensions
don’t work:

#### Chrome’s Extensions Page

**chrome://extensions/**

- **Purpose**: Manage your installed extensions, disable or remove them, and view details.
- **Reason for Restriction**: Protects the integrity of your extensions and browser settings.

#### Firefox’s Add-ons Page`

**about:addons**

- **Purpose**: Similar to Chrome’s Extensions page, this is where you manage add-ons in Firefox.
- **Reason for Restriction**: Ensures add-ons cannot interfere with the management of other add-ons.

#### Edge’s Extensions Page

**edge://extensions/**

- **Purpose**: Provides an overview and control over your installed extensions in Edge.
- **Reason for Restriction**: Prevents extensions from interfering with browser settings.

#### Safari’s Preferences Pages

**about://preferences**

- **Purpose**: Where you adjust settings in Safari, including privacy, security, and general browser
  behavior.
- **Reason for Restriction**: Keeps your browser’s settings secure from potential modification by
  extensions.

### What You Can Do

If you need to manage your extensions or browser settings:

#### Use Standard Browser Features

For managing extensions, use the built-in tools provided by the browser itself, like Chrome’s
**chrome://extensions/** page.

#### Check for Browser Updates

Sometimes, a browser update may change how or where extensions can operate. Keeping your browser
up-to-date ensures you’re using the most secure and stable version.

#### Contact Support

If you’re experiencing issues with Helperbird on regular websites and not just internal pages, it
could be a different problem. Feel free to
[contact Helperbird support](mailto:support@helperbird.com) for assistance.

### Summary

Extensions like Helperbird are designed to enhance your browsing experience on regular websites.
However, due to security and technical reasons, they cannot interact with internal browser pages
like **chrome://extensions/** or **about:addons**. These restrictions help keep your browser secure
and stable, ensuring a smooth and safe browsing experience.
