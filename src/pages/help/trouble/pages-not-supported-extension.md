Noticed Helperbird doesn't work on pages like chrome://extensions/? That's normal. All extensions are blocked from these pages by your browser for security reasons.

---

## Step 1: It's a Browser Security Feature

Your browser blocks all extensions from running on its internal settings pages. This protects your browser from security risks and keeps it stable. It's not a Helperbird bug—it's how all browsers work.


---

## Step 2: Which Pages Are Affected

Any page starting with **chrome://**, **edge://**, **about:**, or similar won't work with extensions. Common examples include chrome://extensions/, chrome://settings/, about:addons, and edge://extensions/. These are your browser's internal pages.


---

## Step 3: How to Use Helperbird

Just go to any regular website and Helperbird will work normally. Only internal browser pages are restricted. If Helperbird isn't working on a normal website, contact our support team.

**Tip:** Quick way to tell if a page is internal—check if the URL starts with chrome://, edge://, or about:. If it does, extensions won't work there!
