If you've entered your subscription key or logged in with your email, but Helperbird Pro isn't
unlocking, it might be because of a network or firewall issue. Don’t worry—here’s how you can check
and fix it.

### 1. Make Sure Helperbird Can Connect

Helperbird needs to connect to our server to verify your subscription. To do this, your network
needs to allow access to:

- [https://engine.helperbird.app](https://engine.helperbird.app)

If you're on a work or school network, you might need to ask your IT admin to allow this URL.

### 2. Check for Network or Firewall Blockages

If you think your network might be blocking Helperbird, you can quickly check it yourself:

#### 1. Visit the Firewall Test Page

- Go to [https://engine.helperbird.app/firewall/](https://engine.helperbird.app/firewall/).

#### 2. See the Test Result

- If you see a message that says, **"You should be able to unlock Helperbird Pro—no network or
  firewall is blocking you,"** then your network is clear, and Helperbird should work fine.
- But if Helperbird Pro still isn't unlocking, it might be something else. In that case, get in
  touch with our support team.

### 3. Still Having Trouble?

If you've done all this and Helperbird Pro still won't unlock, we're here to help. Just
[contact Helperbird support](mailto:support@helperbird.com), and we'll get you sorted out.
