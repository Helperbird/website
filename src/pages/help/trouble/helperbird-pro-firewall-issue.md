If you've entered your subscription key or logged in but Helperbird Pro still won't unlock, your network or firewall might be blocking the connection. 

Let's figure out what's happening and get you back up and running.

---

## Step 1: Check Helperbird Server Connection

Helperbird needs to connect to our server to verify your subscription. Your network must allow access to **https://engine.helperbird.app**. 

If you're on a work or school network, your IT department might be blocking this URL. You may need to ask your IT admin to whitelist it so Helperbird can connect properly.


---

## Step 2: Test Your Network and Firewall

The easiest way to check if your network is blocking Helperbird is to run our quick test. Open your browser and go to **https://engine.helperbird.app/firewall/**. 

If you see the message **You should be able to unlock Helperbird Proâ€”no network or firewall is blocking you.** then your network is clear and Helperbird should work. 

If you see a different message or get an error, your network or firewall is likely blocking the connection.


---

## Step 3: Get Help If Still Blocked

If the firewall test shows everything is clear but Helperbird Pro still won't unlock, something else might be going on. Reach out to our support team at **support@helperbird.com** and let us know you've already run the firewall test. We'll help you troubleshoot and get Helperbird working for you.


**Tip:** If you're on a school or work network, having your IT admin whitelist https://engine.helperbird.app ahead of time can save you a lot of hassle!
