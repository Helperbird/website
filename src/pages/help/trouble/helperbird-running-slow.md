If Helperbird feels slow or is causing pages to lag, here are some ways to speed things up.

---

## Step 1: Disable Unused Features

Having many features enabled at once can slow things down. Open Helperbird and turn off any features you're not actively using.

Focus on keeping only the features you need for your current task. You can always turn others back on when needed.

---

## Step 2: Refresh the Page

If Helperbird has been running on a page for a while, refreshing can help. Press F5 or click the refresh button in your browser to reload the page with a fresh start.

---

## Step 3: Check Other Extensions

Other browser extensions can conflict with Helperbird or use up resources.

Try disabling other extensions temporarily to see if performance improves. If it does, re-enable them one by one to find the culprit.

---

## Step 4: Close Unused Tabs

Having many tabs open uses memory and can slow down extensions. Close tabs you're not using to free up resources for Helperbird.

---

## Step 5: Clear Browser Cache

A cluttered cache can slow down your browser. Clear your browser's cache and cookies:

**Chrome:** Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data

**Edge:** Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data

**Firefox:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Clear Data

---

## Step 6: Update Your Browser

Older browser versions can have performance issues. Make sure you're running the latest version of your browser.

**Chrome:** Menu > Help > About Google Chrome

**Edge:** Menu > Help and feedback > About Microsoft Edge

**Firefox:** Menu > Help > About Firefox

---

## Step 7: Update Helperbird

Make sure you have the latest version of Helperbird installed. Updates often include performance improvements.

Check your browser's extension page to see if an update is available.

---

## Step 8: Restart Your Browser

If you've had your browser open for a long time, restarting it can clear memory and improve performance. Close all browser windows and reopen your browser.

---

## Step 9: Check the Website

Some websites are heavy and slow regardless of Helperbird. If Helperbird works fine on other sites but struggles on one particular site, the issue might be with that website.

Try disabling Helperbird on that specific site if needed.
