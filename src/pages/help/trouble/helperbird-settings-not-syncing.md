If your Helperbird settings aren't syncing between devices, here's how to fix it.

---

## Step 1: Check Browser Sync Is Enabled

Helperbird uses your browser's built-in sync feature to save settings across devices.

**Chrome:** Go to Settings > You and Google > Turn on sync. Make sure "Extensions" is included in what syncs.

**Edge:** Go to Settings > Profiles > Sync > Turn on sync. Ensure "Extensions" is enabled.

**Firefox:** Go to Settings > Sync > Make sure you're signed in and "Add-ons" is selected.

---

## Step 2: Log In to Helperbird

If you have Helperbird Pro, make sure you're logged in with the same account on all devices.

Open Helperbird, scroll to the bottom, and click **Settings**. Check that you're logged in. If not, log in with your email or subscription key.

---

## Step 3: Use the Same Browser Account

For sync to work, you need to be signed into the same browser account on all devices. Using different Google accounts on Chrome, for example, will keep your settings separate.

---

## Step 4: Wait a Few Minutes

Sync isn't always instant. After making changes, wait a few minutes, then check your other device. You may also need to refresh Helperbird on the other device.

---

## Step 5: Check Private/Incognito Mode

Settings don't sync in private or incognito browsing modes. If you're using a private window, your changes won't save or sync.

---

## Step 6: Restart Your Browser

Sometimes sync gets stuck. Close your browser completely on both devices, then reopen them. This can kick-start the sync process.

---

## Step 7: Reinstall Helperbird

If nothing else works, try removing and reinstalling Helperbird. Your settings should restore from sync once you sign back in.

Before reinstalling, make note of any custom settings you want to keep, just in case.
