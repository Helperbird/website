Subscribed to Helperbird Pro but features still show as locked? Here's how to fix it.

---

## Step 1: Check Your Login

Open Helperbird and scroll to the bottom. Click **Settings** to open the settings page. Look for your subscription status—it should show "Pro" if you're logged in correctly.

If it shows "Free," you need to log in with your Pro account.

---

## Step 2: Log In With Your Email

In Helperbird Settings, look for the login section. Enter the email address you used when you subscribed to Helperbird Pro. Click sign in and check your email for a login link.

Make sure you're using the exact same email that's associated with your subscription.

---

## Step 3: Use Your Subscription Key

If email login isn't working, try using your subscription key instead.

Your subscription key was sent to you in your welcome email when you subscribed. Look for an email from Helperbird with "subscription" or "welcome" in the subject.

Enter the key in the subscription key field in Helperbird Settings.

---

## Step 4: Enable Browser Sync

Helperbird's email login requires browser sync to be enabled.

**Chrome:** Go to Settings > You and Google > Turn on sync.

**Edge:** Go to Settings > Profiles > Sync > Turn on sync.

After enabling sync, try logging in again.

---

## Step 5: Check Your Subscription Status

Visit the [Helperbird subscription portal](https://www.helperbird.com/subscription/) to check if your subscription is active.

Enter your email and log in to see your subscription status. If it shows as expired or cancelled, you'll need to renew.

---

## Step 6: Clear and Re-enter

Sometimes the login gets stuck. Try this:

1. Open Helperbird Settings
2. Clear any existing subscription key
3. Log out if you're logged in
4. Close the settings tab
5. Reopen Helperbird and try logging in fresh

---

## Step 7: Try a Different Browser

If you have Helperbird installed on multiple browsers, try logging in on a different one. If it works there, the issue is specific to the original browser.

---

## Step 8: Request Your Key

Can't find your subscription key? Email us at support@helperbird.com with the email address you used to subscribe, and we'll send you your key.
