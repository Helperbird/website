## Introduction

This guide will teach you how to enable and customize the magnifying feature in Helperbird. 

## Prerequisites

You must have the Helperbird browser extension installed.

You should be on a webpage where you want to use the zoom/magnifying feature.

## How to Use the Magnifier Feature in Helperbird

The Magnifier is a fantastic tool to enhance your reading experience by zooming into areas on your screen. Let's break down how to activate and adjust the Magnifier.

### Turning On the Magnifier

**Step 1**: Click the Helperbird icon in your browser's toolbar to open the extension.

**Step 2**: In the extension menu, locate the Magnifier feature. You may need to use the search feature to find it.

**Step 3**: Toggle the switch next to the Magnifier to turn it on. The feature will activate, and you'll see a magnifying lens appear on your screen.

### Adjusting the Magnifier

**Step 1**: With the Magnifier turned on, look for the "Percentage" slider in the Magnifier section of the menu.

**Step 2**: Click and drag the "Percentage" slider to adjust the level of magnification according to your preference. You can make it larger (more than 100%) for greater magnification or smaller (less than 100%) for less.

**Step 3**: As you adjust the slider, the magnification level on your screen will change in real-time, so you can find the perfect zoom level for your needs.
