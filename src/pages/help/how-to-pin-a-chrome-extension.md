## How to pin a Chrome or Edge extension

Open Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and navigate to the extension you wish to pin.
Click on the three dots in the top right corner of the extension box.
Select "Pin" from the drop-down menu.
The extension will now be pinned to the top of your browser and will remain there until you choose to unpin it.
Note: If you are using Microsoft Edge (chromium) the steps are the same, but the icon will be three dots vertical instead of horizontal.
