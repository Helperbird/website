## Using the Volume Booster Feature in Helperbird

The Volume Booster feature in Helperbird allows you to increase the volume beyond the maximum level set by your device, making it easier to listen to audio on web pages.

### Turning On Volume Booster

**Step 1**: Click on the Helperbird icon in your browser's toolbar to open the Helperbird menu.

**Step 2**: In the Helperbird menu, use the search bar at the top to search for "Volume Booster".

**Step 3**: Locate the "Volume Booster" option within the Media Options section.

**Step 4**: Click on the toggle switch next to "Volume Booster" to turn the feature on. When activated, the toggle will change color, indicating that the feature is enabled.

### Adjusting the Volume Booster

**Step 5**: Once the Volume Booster is turned on, you'll see a slider appear below the toggle switch. This slider allows you to adjust the volume boost percentage.

**Step 6**: Click and drag the slider to the right to increase the volume boost. You can boost the volume up to 600% of the original level. The percentage will be displayed next to the slider as you adjust it.

**Step 7**: Adjust the slider to your desired level. As you move the slider, the change in volume should be noticeable immediately on any playing media.

**Step 8**: To reset the volume to the normal level, simply drag the slider back to 100% or turn off the Volume Booster toggle.

Please be cautious with high volume levels, especially when using headphones, as they can harm your hearing.
