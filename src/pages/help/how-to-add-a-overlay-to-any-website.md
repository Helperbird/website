## Using the Overlay & Tints Feature in Helperbird

Helperbird's Overlay & Tints feature can make reading on your screen easier on the eyes, especially for individuals with dyslexia or Irlen Syndrome. It allows you to apply a color filter to your screen for better visual comfort.

### Activating Overlay & Tints

**Step 1**: Click on the Helperbird icon in your browser to open the extension menu.

**Step 2**: Use the search function at the top of the menu to quickly locate 'Overlay & Tints'.

**Step 3**: Toggle the switch next to 'Overlay & Tints' to turn the feature on.

**Step 4**: The screen will now have a color overlay, which can reduce glare and improve readability.

### Customizing the Color of the Overlay

**Step 1**: With the 'Overlay & Tints' feature active, you will see a palette of colors.

**Step 2**: Select a color that you find soothing and that improves the text's readability for you.

**Step 3**: Click on your chosen color circle to apply it as the overlay color on your screen.

### Adjusting the Brightness of the Overlay

**Step 1**: Look for the 'Brightness' slider that appears under the color palette.

**Step 2**: Drag the slider to the left to decrease the brightness, adding a darker shade to your overlay, or to the right to increase the brightness for a lighter shade.

**Step 3**: Adjust the brightness to a level that feels comfortable for your eyes and enhances your focus.
