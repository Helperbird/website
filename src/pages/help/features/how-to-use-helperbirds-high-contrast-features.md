Helperbird's High Contrast feature makes webpages easier to read by adjusting colors and contrast. Choose from several contrast styles to find what works best for you.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Go to Display Options

In the list of tools, find **Display Options** and click the open icon next to it.

---

## Step 3: Choose Contrast Style

Toggle on **High contrast** to activate the feature. You'll see several contrast styles to choose from:

**Increased Contrast**: Boosts the contrast between text and backgrounds without changing colors, making everything sharper and clearer.

**Greyscale**: Converts the entire page to shades of grey, removing all color distractions while maintaining clear contrast.

**Inverted Color**: Flips all colors on the page to their opposites, turning light backgrounds dark and dark text light, which helps reduce glare.

**Inverted Greyscale**: Combines greyscale with inverted colors for a high-contrast black and white view that's easy on the eyes.

**Yellow on Black**: Displays all text in yellow on a black background, a color combination that's particularly helpful for people with visual impairments.

Click any style to apply it instantly. The webpage will update immediately with your chosen contrast settings.


**Tip:** Try different contrast styles to see which one feels most comfortable for your eyes. Many users find inverted colors helpful in low-light environments.
