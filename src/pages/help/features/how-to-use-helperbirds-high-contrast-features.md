## What is High Contrast?

High Contrast mode changes the colors on a website to make text and images easier to see. It increases the difference between light and dark areas, which can make reading much easier.

Helperbird offers several different contrast styles so you can choose the one that works best for you.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with low vision who need stronger contrast
- Anyone with visual impairments

## Step 4: Open Display Options

Click on **Display options** to open it.

A panel will appear showing various display settings you can adjust.

---

## Contrast Styles

Helperbird offers five different high contrast styles:

- **Increased Contrast** – Makes the existing colors stronger without changing them. Text becomes sharper and easier to read against backgrounds.

- **Greyscale** – Removes all colors from the page. Everything appears in shades of grey, black, and white. This is helpful if colors are distracting.

- **Inverted Color** – Flips all colors to their opposites. Light backgrounds become dark, and dark text becomes light. This is useful for reducing glare from bright pages.

- **Inverted Greyscale** – Combines greyscale and inverted colors. The page becomes black and white with the colors flipped. Good for maximum contrast.

- **Yellow on Black** – Displays text in yellow on a black background. This specific color combination is very helpful for many people with visual impairments.

**Tip:** Try each style to see which one is most comfortable for your eyes. Many people find that different styles work better for different websites or lighting conditions.
