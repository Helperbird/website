## Choosing Your High Contrast Style

### Increased Contrast

Once **High contrast** is turned on, click **Increased contrast** to boost the contrast on the page.

### Greyscale

Select the **Greyscale** option to change everything to shades of grey, which can help reduce distractions.

### Inverted Colors

Choose **Inverted colors** to flip the colors on the page, which can help with glare and readability.

### Inverted Greyscale

Click on **Inverted greyscale** to flip the greyscale colors, giving you a high-contrast view that some users find easier to read.

### Yellow on Black

1For a high-contrast theme with yellow text on a black background, pick **Yellow on black**. This is often preferred by people with certain visual impairments.

As soon as you select one of these options, the webpage will instantly adjust to the new high contrast style, making it easier to see and read.

High contrast uses a few strong colors to make everything easier to see. It’s different from simply inverting the display, but it can look similar because of the darker color scheme.
