## What are Paragraph Borders?

Paragraph Borders adds visible colored outlines around each paragraph on a webpage. This helps you clearly see where one paragraph ends and another begins, making it easier to track your place while reading.

You can choose any border color you like to match your reading preferences.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who lose their place while reading long text
- Anyone who finds walls of text hard to navigate
- Students reading dense articles or essays
- People with dyslexia or attention difficulties
- Anyone who wants clearer visual separation between paragraphs

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with several tabs at the top.

---

## Step 4: Open the Border Tab

At the top of the Text settings panel, you will see tabs like Text, Colors, and Border.

## Step 5: Turn on Border

In the Border tab, find **Border** with a toggle switch next to it.

Click the toggle to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

Your choice is saved automatically.
