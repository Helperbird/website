## Step 3: Print Your Webpage

In the Accessibility panel, click the **Print** button. This will open your browser's print dialog where you can choose your destination (like saving as PDF or selecting a printer), select which pages to print, adjust the layout, and customize other print settings. Once you're happy with your settings, click the **Save** or **Print** button.
