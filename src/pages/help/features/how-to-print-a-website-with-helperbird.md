## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Accessibility

Look through the list of features until you see **Accessibility**.

---

## Step 4: Open Accessibility

Click on **Accessibility** to open it.

A panel will appear showing the accessibility options available in Helperbird.

---

## Step 5: Click Print

In the Accessibility panel, click the **Print** button.

This will open your browser's print dialog. Here you can:

- Choose your printer or select "Save as PDF"
- Select which pages to print
- Adjust the layout (portrait or landscape)
- Change the paper size
- Customize other print settings

Once you are happy with your settings, click the **Save** or **Print** button.
