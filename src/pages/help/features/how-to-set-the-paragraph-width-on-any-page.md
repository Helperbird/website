## What is Paragraph Width?

Paragraph Width controls how wide the text appears on a webpage. Instead of text stretching all the way across the screen, you can make paragraphs narrower so your eyes do not have to travel as far from line to line.

Narrower text is often easier and more comfortable to read.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find wide text blocks tiring to read
- Anyone who loses their place on long lines
- Students reading on wide monitors
- People with dyslexia who benefit from shorter line lengths
- Anyone who wants a more comfortable reading experience

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with several tabs at the top.

---


## Step 4: Open the Border Tab

At the top of the Text settings panel, you will see tabs like Text, Colors, and Border.

Click on the **Border** tab.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Width

In the Border tab, find **Width** with a toggle switch next to it.

Click the toggle to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 6: Adjust the Width

After turning on Width, a slider will appear.

Move the slider left to make paragraphs narrower, or right to make them wider.

**Tip:** Try setting paragraphs to around 60-80% width for easier eye tracking and less strain during long reading sessions.
