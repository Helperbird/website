Adjusting paragraph width helps you focus on text by narrowing or widening how much content appears on each line, making reading feel more natural.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Reading Options

In the list of tools, find **Reading Options** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Adjust Paragraph Width

In the Reading Options panel:
1. Go to the **Border** tab.
2. Toggle **Width** **on**.
3. Use the **slider** to adjust the widthâ€”slide left to narrow paragraphs or right to widen them until it feels just right.



**Tip:** Try setting paragraphs to around 60-80% width for easier eye tracking and less strain during long reading sessions.
