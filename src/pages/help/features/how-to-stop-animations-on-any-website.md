Helperbird's Reduce Motion feature minimizes animations and visual effects on websites, making browsing more comfortable if you're sensitive to movement or find animations distracting.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Go to Accessibility

In the list of tools, find **Accessibility** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Turn On Reduce Motion

In the Accessibility panel, toggle on **Reduce Motion**. Animations and movements on websites will now be toned down, creating a calmer browsing experience.


**Tip:** This feature is especially helpful if you experience motion sensitivity or vestibular disorders, as it reduces potentially triggering animations while keeping websites fully functional.
