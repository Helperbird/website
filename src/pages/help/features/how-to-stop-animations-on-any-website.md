## What is Reduce Motion?

Reduce Motion tells websites to minimize or stop animations and moving effects. This includes things like sliding menus, bouncing buttons, parallax scrolling, and other animated elements.

When enabled, websites that respect this setting will show simpler, calmer versions of their pages with less movement.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with vestibular disorders who get dizzy from motion
- Anyone who experiences motion sickness from screen animations
- People with ADHD who find animations distracting
- Anyone with epilepsy who is sensitive to flashing or moving content
- People who simply prefer a calmer browsing experience

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Accessibility

Look through the list of features until you see **Accessibility**.

---

## Step 4: Open Accessibility

Click on **Accessibility** to open it.

A panel will appear showing the accessibility options available in Helperbird.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Reduce Motion

In the Accessibility panel, look for **Reduce motion**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

Websites will now show with reduced animations. The effect depends on how each website is built. Well-designed websites will respect this setting and show calmer versions of their animations.

**Tip:** For even fewer moving elements, you can also use the Hide GIFs feature in Media options to stop animated images from playing.
