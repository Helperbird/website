## What is Paragraph Width?

Paragraph Width lets you control how wide text paragraphs appear on any website. Narrower text columns can be easier to read because your eyes don't have to travel as far across the screen.

This is a Helperbird Pro feature.

---

## Who is This For?

Paragraph Width is helpful for people who find wide text columns hard to follow, readers on large monitors where text stretches too wide, anyone with reading difficulties like dyslexia, people who prefer a book-like reading experience, and users who want to reduce eye strain from long lines of text.

## How to Adjust Paragraph Width

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension menu.

---

### Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the **All Features** section and expand it to see all available features.

---

### Step 3: Find Paragraph Width

Look for the **Paragraph Width** option in the Text settings area. Click on it to open the settings panel.

---

### Step 4: Adjust the Width

Use the slider to set your preferred paragraph width. Moving the slider left makes paragraphs narrower, while moving it right makes them wider.

The toggle will turn GREEN when the feature is enabled.

**Tip:** A width of 60-80 characters per line is often considered optimal for comfortable reading.

---

## Finding Your Ideal Width

Start by narrowing the text slightly and reading a few paragraphs. If it feels cramped, widen it a bit. The goal is to find a width where your eyes can easily follow from the end of one line to the beginning of the next without losing your place.
