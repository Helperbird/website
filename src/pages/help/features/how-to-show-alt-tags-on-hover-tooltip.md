## What are Link & Image Descriptions?

Link & Image Descriptions shows you hidden information about images and links on a webpage. When you hover your mouse over an image, you will see its alt text (a description of what the image shows). When you hover over a link, you will see where it leads.

This helps you understand what images contain and where links go before clicking them.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who want to know where a link leads before clicking
- Anyone who uses screen readers and wants to check alt text
- Web developers checking accessibility on pages
- People with visual impairments who need image descriptions
- Anyone curious about the hidden information on webpages
