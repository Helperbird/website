Helperbird's hover descriptions feature lets you see alt text for images and title tags for links simply by moving your mouse over them. This is incredibly helpful for understanding context, checking accessibility information, or just learning more about what's on the page.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Media Options

Scroll down through the Helperbird menu and click on **Media Options** to open the media settings panel.


---

## Step 3: Enable Hover Descriptions

In the Media Options panel, click on the **Hover** tab at the top. You'll see two options you can toggle:

**Link descriptions**: Displays the title tag (descriptive text) of any link when you hover your mouse over it, giving you context about where the link leads before clicking.

**Image descriptions**: Shows the alt text (alternative text description) of images when you hover over them, letting you see what the image represents even if it hasn't loaded or for accessibility purposes.

Toggle on the descriptions you want to see. Once enabled, simply hover your mouse over any image or link on a webpage to see its description appear in a tooltip.


**Tip:** Turn on both Link descriptions and Image descriptions together to get the fullest picture of webpage content, especially useful when researching or checking if a site is accessible.
