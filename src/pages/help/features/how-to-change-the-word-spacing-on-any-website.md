## What is Word Spacing?

Word spacing adds extra space between each word in the text. Instead of words being close together, they are spread out more.

For example, "The quick brown fox" with increased word spacing would have larger gaps between each word, making it easier to see where one word ends and the next begins.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who find words blending together
- Anyone who loses their place while reading
- People with visual processing difficulties
- Students reading dense paragraphs of text
- Anyone who finds it hard to distinguish between words

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

Make sure the **Text** tab is selected. This is where you will find the word spacing option.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Word Spacing

In the Text tab, scroll down until you see **Word spacing**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Spacing

Once Word spacing is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to increase the space between words. Drag it to the left to decrease the spacing.

The changes will apply to the website immediately, so you can see the effect as you adjust the slider.

**Tip:** Word spacing works well when combined with letter spacing and line height. Try adjusting all three together to find your perfect reading setup.
