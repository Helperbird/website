## What is Emphasize Links?

Emphasize Links adds colorblind-friendly underlines beneath every link on a webpage. This makes links much easier to spot, even if you have difficulty distinguishing certain colors.

Many websites style links with just a color change and no underline. This can make them impossible to find for people with color blindness. Emphasize Links solves this by adding clear visual indicators to all links.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with color blindness who cannot see colored links
- Anyone who has trouble distinguishing links from regular text
- People with low vision who need clearer link indicators
- Anyone who wants links to be more visible
- People who find subtle link styling hard to notice

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Display Options

Look through the list of features until you see **Display options**.

---


## Step 4: Open Display Options

Click on **Display options** to open it.

A panel will appear showing various display settings you can adjust.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Emphasize Links

In the Display options panel, look for **Emphasize links**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

All links on the page will now have colorblind-friendly underlines, making them stand out clearly no matter what color they are.

**Tip:** This feature works great alongside high contrast mode for even better visibility when browsing.
