Helperbird's Emphasize Links feature adds colorblind-friendly underlines beneath every link on a webpage, making them much easier to spot if you have difficulty distinguishing colors.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.


---

## Step 2: Go to Display Options

In the list of tools, find **Display Options** and click the open icon next to it.

## Step 3: Turn On Emphasize Links

In the Display Options panel, toggle on **Emphasize links**. 

All links on the page will now have colorblind-friendly underlines, making them stand out clearly no matter what color they are.
