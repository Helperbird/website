## What is the PDF Reader?

The PDF Reader is a built-in tool that lets you open and read PDF documents directly in your browser with extra accessibility features. It includes tools for note-taking, annotations, voice typing, translation, and more.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Students who read PDF textbooks and lecture notes
- Researchers who work with academic papers
- Anyone who needs to annotate PDF documents
- People who want text-to-speech for PDFs
- Anyone who needs to translate or summarize PDF content

---


## Step 1: Open a PDF in Helperbird

When you view a PDF in your browser, look for the green **"Open PDF in Helperbird – Click to Open"** button at the bottom of the page.

Click this button.

The PDF will open in Helperbird's reader interface with all tools available.

---


## Step 2: Navigate and Read

Once your PDF is open, you will see page numbers at the top for easy navigation.

Use the arrow buttons or type a page number to jump to a specific page.

You can also zoom in and out using the zoom controls.

---


## Step 3: Take Notes

To open the note-taking panel, click the **note button** in the top toolbar.

This opens a split view with your PDF on the left and a note editor on the right.

In the note editor you can:

- **Type notes** – Write your thoughts as you read
- **Voice Typing** – Click the microphone icon to dictate notes instead of typing
- **Grammar/Spell Check** – Click the "A" with checkmark icon to check for errors
- **Print** – Click the print icon to print your notes
- **Download** – Save your notes or the annotated PDF

---


## Step 4: Use Quick Tools

Click the floating pink menu button on the right side of the screen to access quick tools:

- **Extract Text** – Pull text from the PDF to use elsewhere
- **Summarize** – Get a quick summary of the PDF content
- **View in Immersive Reader** – Open the PDF in a clean reading mode
- **Translate** – Translate the PDF content into different languages

**Tip:** The PDF Reader combines all of Helperbird's powerful tools in one place, making it perfect for studying, research, and document review. Use voice typing for quick note-taking and Annotation Mode to mark up important sections directly on the PDF.
