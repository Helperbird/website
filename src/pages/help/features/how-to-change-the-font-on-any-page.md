## What is the Font Feature?

Helperbird lets you change the font on any website to one that is easier for you to read. This means you can replace hard-to-read fonts with clearer, more comfortable options like Lexend, OpenDyslexic, or Comic Sans.

The font change applies to all the text on the page instantly, so you can see the difference right away.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who find certain fonts easier to read
- Anyone who struggles with small, thin, or decorative fonts
- Students who want a consistent reading experience across different websites
- People with visual stress or eye strain
- Anyone who simply prefers a different font style

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---


## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

Make sure the **Text** tab is selected. This is where you will find the font options.

---


## Step 5: Turn on the Font Feature

In the Text tab, you will see **Font** at the top with a toggle switch next to it.

Click the toggle switch to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 6: Choose Your Font

Once the Font feature is on, a list of fonts will appear below the toggle.

Click on any font name to select it. A green checkmark will appear next to the font you choose.

The font will apply to the website immediately. You can try different fonts to see which one you like best.
