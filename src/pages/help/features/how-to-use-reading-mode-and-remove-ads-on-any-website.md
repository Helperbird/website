## What is Reading Mode?

Reading Mode removes distractions from a webpage and shows you just the main content. It gets rid of ads, navigation menus, sidebars, and other elements that can make reading difficult.

The result is a clean, simple view that looks like a book or document, making it much easier to focus on reading.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who are distracted by ads and other page elements
- Anyone with dyslexia who benefits from simplified layouts
- People with ADHD who need fewer distractions
- Students reading articles for research
- Anyone who finds cluttered websites overwhelming

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Reading Mode

Look through the list of features until you see **Reading Mode**.

It has a document or page icon next to it.

---

## Step 4: Click Reading Mode

Click on **Reading Mode**.

The webpage will transform into a clean reading view. All the ads, sidebars, navigation menus, and other distracting elements will be removed.

You will see just the main text and images from the article.

---

## Step 5: Customize Your View

Once in Reading Mode, you can adjust how the content looks using the toolbar at the top of the page.

You can change:

- **Text size** – Make the text larger or smaller
- **Font** – Choose a different font that is easier to read
- **Background color** – Change the background to reduce eye strain
- **Text color** – Adjust the color of the text

These settings help you create a reading experience that works best for you.

---

## Step 6: Exit Reading Mode

When you are done reading, click the **X** button in the top corner of the Reading Mode view.

This will return you to the normal webpage.

**Tip:** Reading Mode works best on articles, blog posts, and news stories. It may not work well on pages that are mostly images or interactive content.
