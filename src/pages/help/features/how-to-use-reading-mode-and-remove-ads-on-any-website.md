## What is Reading Mode?

Reading Mode in Helperbird is a feature designed to improve your reading experience on websites and PDFs. It strips away all the unnecessary elements—like ads, pop-ups, and other distractions—leaving you with just the core content in a clean, easy-to-read format. 

Whether you’re reading a news article, a blog post, or a document, Reading Mode helps you stay focused on what’s important.

### Benefits of Using Reading Mode

#### Distraction-Free Reading

By removing ads, sidebars, and other distractions, Reading Mode helps you focus solely on the text, making it easier to absorb and understand the content.

#### Cleaner Layout

Reading Mode reformats the page into a simpler layout, with clear fonts and proper spacing, which can reduce eye strain and make reading more comfortable.

#### Better Focus

For people who struggle with attention or are easily distracted, Reading Mode creates a streamlined reading environment that helps maintain focus and improve comprehension.

#### Customizable Settings

You can adjust the text size, background color, and font to suit your reading preferences, making it easier to read for longer periods without discomfort.

#### Improved Accessibility 

Reading Mode is particularly beneficial for people with dyslexia or other reading difficulties, as it presents the text in a way that’s easier to process, without the visual clutter that can make reading challenging.

#### Consistency Across Devices

Whether you’re on your laptop, tablet, or smartphone, Reading Mode ensures a consistent reading experience across all your devices.
