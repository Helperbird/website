Helperbird's Reading Mode removes ads, sidebars, and distractions from webpages, giving you a clean, focused reading experience with just the content that matters.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Find Reading Mode

Look for the **Reading Mode** button in the quick actions at the top of Helperbird. It's the first purple button on the left.

---

## Step 3: Activate Reading Mode

Click the **Reading Mode** button to transform the current webpage into a clean, distraction-free reading view. 

The page will strip away ads, sidebars, and unnecessary elements, leaving only the main content.

You can adjust text size, font, and background color using the toolbar at the top. Click the X button to exit Reading Mode when you're done.


**Tip:** Reading Mode works great on news articles, blog posts, and PDFs. Try customizing the text settings to reduce eye strain during long reading sessions.
