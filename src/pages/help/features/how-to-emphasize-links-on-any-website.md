## What is Emphasize Links?

Emphasize Links makes all clickable links on a webpage more visible by adding clear styling like underlines. Many websites remove underlines from links, which can make them hard to find. This feature ensures you can always spot links easily.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who have difficulty distinguishing links from regular text
- Anyone with low vision who needs clearer visual cues
- People who prefer consistent link styling across all websites
- Anyone who finds it frustrating when links are hard to identify
- People with cognitive differences who benefit from clear navigation

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Emphasize Links

Look through the list of features until you see **Emphasize links**.

---

## Step 4: Turn on Emphasize Links

Click the toggle switch next to **Emphasize links** to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

All links on the page will immediately become more visible with clear underline styling.

**Tip:** Combine this feature with the Link Color feature to make links stand out even more with a custom color.
