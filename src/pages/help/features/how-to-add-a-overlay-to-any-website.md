## What is a Color Overlay?

A color overlay adds a transparent colored layer on top of the entire webpage. It is like looking through a sheet of colored plastic or glass.

Many people find that a tinted overlay reduces the harsh contrast of black text on white backgrounds. This can make text appear calmer and easier to read.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who benefit from colored overlays
- Anyone with Irlen Syndrome or visual stress
- People who find bright white screens uncomfortable
- Anyone who experiences eye strain or headaches when reading online
- Students who need to read for long periods

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Dyslexia Support

Look through the list of features until you see **Dyslexia support**.

It has a purple icon with a brain symbol on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Dyslexia Support

Click on **Dyslexia support** to open it.

A panel will appear with two tabs at the top: **Tools** and **Settings**.

Make sure the **Tools** tab is selected. This is where you will find the Overlay toggle.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Overlay

In the Tools tab, look for **Overlay**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

A colored tint will immediately appear over the entire webpage.

---

## Step 6: Customize the Overlay

To adjust the overlay color and intensity, click on the **Settings** tab at the top of the panel.

Here you can choose different colors and adjust how strong the overlay appears.

---

## Overlay Settings

In the Settings tab, you can customize the following:

- **Color** – Choose a color for the overlay. Popular choices include yellow, blue, pink, and green. Different colors work better for different people, so try a few to find what is most comfortable for you.

- **Brightness** – Adjust how strong the overlay is. A lower brightness makes the overlay more transparent, while a higher brightness makes the color more intense.

**Tip:** Many people with dyslexia or Irlen Syndrome find that certain specific colors work best for them. If you have worked with a specialist who recommended a particular overlay color, you can match it here. Try different colors and brightness levels to find what feels most comfortable for your eyes.
