## What is Zoom?

The Zoom feature magnifies the entire webpage, making everything larger. Text, images, buttons, and all other content get bigger so you can see them more easily.

You can set the zoom level to any percentage you prefer, from making things smaller to making them much larger.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with low vision who need larger text and images
- Anyone who finds website text too small to read
- People using small screens or sitting far from their monitor
- Anyone who experiences eye strain from squinting at small content
- People who want more control over how websites appear

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Display Options

Look through the list of features until you see **Display options**.

---


## Step 4: Open Display Options

Click on **Display options** to open it.

A panel will appear showing various display settings you can adjust.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Zoom

In the Display options panel, look for **Zoom**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 6: Adjust the Zoom Level

Once Zoom is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to zoom in and make the page larger. Drag it to the left to zoom out and make the page smaller.

A percentage number will show you the current zoom level. 100% is normal size, 150% is half again as large, 200% is twice as large, and so on.

The zoom applies immediately so you can see the change right away.

**Tip:** Most people find 125% to 175% comfortable for everyday reading. If you need even larger text, you can combine zoom with the font size feature for maximum enlargement.
