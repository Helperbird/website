Adjusting text alignment helps you read more comfortably by choosing how text is positioned on the pageâ€”left, center, right, or justified.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Reading Options

In the list of tools, find **Reading Options** and click the open icon next to it.



---

## Step 3: Adjust Text Alignment

In the Reading Options panel:
1. Go to the **Text** tab.
2. Toggle **Text Align** **on**.
3. Choose your preferred alignment: **Left**, **Center**, **Right**, or **Justify**.
4. The text will immediately align according to your selection.


**Tip:** Left alignment is easiest for most readers, while justified text creates clean edges on both sides.
