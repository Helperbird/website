## What is Text Alignment?

Text alignment controls how text is positioned horizontally on the page. You can align text to the left edge, center it, align it to the right edge, or justify it so both edges are even.

Different alignment styles can make reading easier depending on your preferences and the type of content you are reading.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find left-aligned text easier to track
- Anyone who prefers a specific text layout
- People with dyslexia who may find certain alignments easier to read
- Students who want consistent formatting across different websites
- Anyone who finds justified text creates uneven spacing that is hard to read

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---


## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

Make sure the **Text** tab is selected. This is where you will find the text alignment option.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Text Alignment

In the Text tab, scroll down until you see **Text align**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 6: Choose Your Alignment

Once Text align is turned on, four alignment buttons will appear below the toggle.

Click on the alignment style you prefer. The text on the website will immediately change to match your selection.

---


## Alignment Options

Helperbird offers four text alignment options:

- **Left** – Text aligns to the left edge. This is the most common and often easiest to read because your eye always returns to the same starting point.

- **Center** – Text is centered in the middle. This works well for headings or short text but can be harder to read for long paragraphs.

- **Right** – Text aligns to the right edge. This is less common for reading but can be useful for certain layouts.

- **Justify** – Text stretches to align with both the left and right edges. This creates clean margins but can cause uneven spacing between words that some people find distracting.

**Tip:** Most people find left-aligned text easiest to read because each line starts at the same place. If you have dyslexia, avoid justified text as the uneven word spacing can make reading harder.
