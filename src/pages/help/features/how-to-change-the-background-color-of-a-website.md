## What is Background Color?

The background color feature lets you change the background color of any website. Instead of reading on a bright white background, you can choose softer colors like cream, light blue, or any color that is easier on your eyes.

This is different from an overlay because it actually changes the page background rather than adding a tinted layer on top.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find bright white backgrounds uncomfortable
- Anyone who experiences eye strain or headaches when reading online
- People with dyslexia who benefit from colored backgrounds
- Students who read for long periods
- Anyone who wants to reduce screen glare

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

---

## Step 5: Go to the Colors Tab

Click on the **Colors** tab to see all the color options.

This is where you will find the background color option along with other color settings.

---

## Step 6: Turn on Background Color

In the Colors tab, look for **Background**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 7: Choose Your Color

Once Background is turned on, a color palette will appear below the toggle.

Click on any color to select it. The background color of the website will change immediately so you can see how it looks.

If you do not see a color you like, you can click the color picker icon to choose any custom color.

**Tip:** Soft, warm colors like cream, light yellow, or light blue are popular choices for reducing eye strain. Avoid very bright or neon colors as they can be just as tiring as white.
