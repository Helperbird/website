## What is Pause?

Pausing Helperbird turns off all features temporarily without losing any of your settings. When you resume, all your customizations come back exactly as they were.

This is useful when you want to see a website in its original format or need to take screenshots without any Helperbird changes applied.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Anyone who needs to temporarily see a website without customizations
- People who want to take screenshots of the original webpage
- Users who need to troubleshoot website issues
- Anyone who wants a quick break from Helperbird features
- People who want to compare before and after views

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Find the On/Off Toggle

At the very top of the Helperbird panel, you will see a toggle button. It says either **Helperbird is on** or **Helperbird is off**.

This toggle controls whether Helperbird features are active.

---

## Step 3: Pause or Resume Helperbird

Click the toggle to turn Helperbird off or back on:

- **To pause** – Click the toggle when it says "Helperbird is on". It will switch to "Helperbird is off" and all features will be temporarily disabled.

- **To resume** – Click the toggle when it says "Helperbird is off". It will switch back to "Helperbird is on" and all your features will be active again.

Your settings are preserved when Helperbird is paused. Nothing is lost.

**Tip:** Pausing Helperbird is perfect when you need to see a website in its original format or want to take screenshots without customizations.
