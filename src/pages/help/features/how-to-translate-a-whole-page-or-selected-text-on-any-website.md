## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.


---

## Step 2: Go to Translate

In the list of tools, find **Translate** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Choose Language and Translate

You'll see a list of available languages. 

Click on the language you want to translate the page into. 

Once you've selected your language, click the **Translate website** button at the bottom. 

A new tab will open showing the entire webpage translated into your chosen language.


**Tip:** Your language choice stays selected, so the next time you want to translate a page, you can just open Helperbird and hit the translate button without choosing a language again.
