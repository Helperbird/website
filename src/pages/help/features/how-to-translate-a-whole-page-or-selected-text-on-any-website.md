## What is Translate?

The Translate feature converts text on a website from one language to another. You can translate an entire webpage or just the text you select.

Helperbird uses Google Translate to provide translations in many different languages.

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Translate

Look through the list of features until you see **Translate**.

Click on **Translate** to open it.

A panel will appear showing a list of languages you can translate to.

---


## Step 4: Choose Your Language

Scroll through the list of languages and click on the language you want to translate the page into.

A green checkmark will appear next to your selected language.

---


## Step 5: Translate the Page

Click the **Translate website** button at the bottom of the panel.

A new browser tab will open showing the entire webpage translated into your chosen language.

Helperbird remembers your language choice, so next time you can just click the Translate website button without selecting a language again.

---


**Tip:** You can also highlight text on a webpage first, then use the Highlight Menu that appears to quickly translate just the selected text.
