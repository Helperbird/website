Splitting text into columns helps you read more comfortably by breaking up wide paragraphs into narrower sections, similar to how newspapers organize content.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Reading Options

In the list of tools, find **Reading Options** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Adjust Paragraph Columns

In the Reading Options panel:
1. Go to the **Border** tab.
2. Toggle **Paragraph Columns** **on**.
3. Use the **slider** to choose how many columns you wantâ€”slide left for fewer columns or right for more.


**Tip:** Two or three columns work great for wide screens, while one column is perfect for smaller displays or focused reading.
