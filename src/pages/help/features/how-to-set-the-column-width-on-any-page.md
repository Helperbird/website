## What are Paragraph Columns?

Paragraph Columns splits the text on a webpage into multiple columns, similar to how newspapers and magazines organize content. Instead of one wide block of text, you get narrower columns that are easier to read.

This helps your eyes track from line to line without getting lost.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find wide text blocks hard to read
- Anyone who loses their place on long lines
- Students reading long articles
- People with dyslexia who benefit from shorter line lengths
- Anyone who prefers a newspaper-style layout

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with several tabs at the top.

---

## Step 4: Open the Border Tab

At the top of the Text settings panel, you will see tabs like Text, Colors, and Border.

Click on the **Border** tab.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Columns

In the Border tab, find **Columns** with a toggle switch next to it.

Click the toggle to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Number of Columns

After turning on Columns, a slider will appear.

Move the slider left or right to choose how many columns you want. Sliding right adds more columns, sliding left reduces them.

**Tip:** Two or three columns work great for wide screens. One column is better for smaller screens or focused reading.
