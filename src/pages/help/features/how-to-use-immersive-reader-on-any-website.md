## What is Immersive Reader?

Immersive Reader is a reading tool made by Microsoft. It takes the text from a webpage and shows it in a clean, simple view without any distractions like ads, menus, or sidebars.

Immersive Reader also includes helpful features like text-to-speech, syllable breaking, parts of speech highlighting, and adjustable text size and spacing.

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Immersive Reader

Look through the list of features until you see **Immersive Reader**.

It has a book icon next to it.

---


## Step 4: Click Immersive Reader

Click on **Immersive Reader**.

The webpage will transform into a clean reading view. You will see just the text and images from the page, without any of the extra elements like navigation menus, ads, or sidebars.

---


## Step 5: Use Immersive Reader Features

Once in Immersive Reader, you will see a toolbar at the top. Here are some features you can use:

- **Text Preferences** – Change the text size, font, and spacing. You can also change the background color to reduce eye strain.

- **Grammar Options** – Turn on syllable breaking to see words split into syllables. You can also highlight different parts of speech like nouns, verbs, and adjectives in different colors.

- **Reading Preferences** – Enable line focus to highlight one line at a time. Turn on picture dictionary to see images for some words.

- **Read Aloud** – Click the play button to have the text read to you. Words are highlighted as they are spoken so you can follow along.

## Reading Selected Text

If you only want to read part of a webpage:

1. First, highlight the text you want to read by clicking and dragging your mouse over it
2. Then open Helperbird and click the Immersive Reader button
3. Immersive Reader will open with only your selected text

This is useful when you want to focus on a specific section of a long article.

**Tip:** Immersive Reader is especially helpful for long articles or academic content. The clean view removes distractions and the read aloud feature lets you listen while following along.
