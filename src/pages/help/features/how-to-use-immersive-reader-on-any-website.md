Helperbird includes Microsoft's Immersive Reader, giving you a clean, focused reading experience on any webpage. It removes distractions and offers features like text-to-speech, adjustable text size, and custom fonts.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.


---

## Step 2: Find Immersive Reader

Look for the **Immersive Reader** button in the quick actions at the top of Helperbird. It's marked with a book icon.

---

## Step 3: Start Reading

Click the **Immersive Reader** button to open the current webpage in Immersive Reader mode. The page will transform into a clean, distraction-free reading view with just the text and images. 

You can also highlight specific text on the page first, then click the Immersive Reader button to read only that selected text.



**Tip:** Once in Immersive Reader, use the toolbar at the top to adjust text size, change fonts, enable text-to-speech, or modify background colors to match your reading preferences.
