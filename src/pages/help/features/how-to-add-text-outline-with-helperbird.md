## What is Text Outline?

Text outline (also called text stroke) adds a colored border around each letter on a website. This creates a clear edge around the text that makes it stand out from the background.

The outline goes around the outside of every letter, making the text easier to see even on busy or colorful backgrounds.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find text hard to see against certain backgrounds
- Anyone with low vision who needs more contrast
- People who read websites with poor text visibility
- Students reading on screens for long periods
- Anyone who wants text to be more defined and clear

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

---

## Step 5: Go to the Border Tab

Click on the **Border** tab to see the text border options.

This is where you will find the text stroke (outline) feature.

---

## Step 6: Turn on Text Stroke

In the Border tab, look for **Text stroke**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 7: Choose Your Outline Color

Once Text stroke is turned on, a color palette will appear below the toggle.

Click on any color to select it. All text on the website will immediately show an outline in your chosen color.

If you do not see a color you like, you can click the color picker icon to choose any custom color.

**Tip:** Black outlines work well on light backgrounds, and white outlines work well on dark backgrounds. Choose a color that contrasts with both the text color and the background for the best visibility.
