Helperbird's Text Outline feature adds a colored border around all text on a webpage, making it easier to read by creating stronger contrast between the text and its background.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.


---

## Step 2: Go to Display Options

In the list of tools, find **Display Options** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Enable Text Outline

Toggle on **Text Outline** in the Display Options panel. 

You'll see a color palette appear below. Click on any color to apply that outline around all text on the page. 

The outline creates a border around each letter, making text stand out more clearly against any background.


**Tip:** Try using a contrasting color to the webpage's background for maximum readability. Black or white outlines work well on most pages.
