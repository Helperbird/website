## What is Selection Highlight Color?

When you click and drag to select text on a website, it becomes highlighted with a color (usually blue). The selection highlight color feature lets you change this to any color you prefer.

This helps you see selected text more clearly, especially if the default blue does not stand out well for you.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find the default blue selection hard to see
- Anyone who wants more contrast when selecting text
- People with color preferences or color vision differences
- Students who frequently select and copy text
- Anyone who wants to personalize their browsing experience

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

---

## Step 5: Go to the Colors Tab

Click on the **Colors** tab to see all the color options.

This is where you will find the highlight color option along with other color settings.

---

## Step 6: Turn on Highlight Color

In the Colors tab, look for **Highlight**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 7: Choose Your Color

Once Highlight is turned on, a color palette will appear below the toggle.

Click on any color to select it. Now when you select text on any website, it will appear in your chosen highlight color.

If you do not see a color you like, you can click the color picker icon to choose any custom color.

**Tip:** Yellow, light green, and light pink are popular choices because they provide good contrast on most websites while still allowing you to read the selected text clearly.
