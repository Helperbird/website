## What are Dyslexia Friendly Fonts?

Dyslexia friendly fonts are specially designed typefaces that make reading easier for people with dyslexia. Fonts like OpenDyslexic and Lexend use unique letter shapes that help reduce confusion between similar letters like b and d or p and q.

Helperbird lets you change any webpage to use these fonts instantly.

## Step 5: Choose a Dyslexia Friendly Font

After turning on Font, a dropdown menu will appear showing available fonts.

The font will apply immediately to all text on the page.
