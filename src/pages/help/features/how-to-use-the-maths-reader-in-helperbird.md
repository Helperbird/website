Helperbird's Math Reader helps you extract math problems and equations from any webpage and view them in Microsoft's Immersive Reader for better readability and understanding.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Find Math Reader

Scroll down in the list of tools to find **Math Reader**. It has a calculator icon.

---

## Step 3: Use Math Reader

Click the Math Reader icon to start. 

A message will appear saying **Drag to Select an Area on the Screen.** 

Click and drag to select the area containing the math problem or equation you want to extract.

Helperbird will process the math content and automatically open it in Immersive Reader, where you can read it more clearly, adjust text size, use text-to-speech, and access other Immersive Reader features.

**Tip:** Math Reader works best when you select a clear area around the math problem. Try to include just the equation or problem you want to read, avoiding extra text or images that might interfere with the extraction.
