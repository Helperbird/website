## What is Math Reader?

Math Reader extracts math problems and equations from any webpage and opens them in Microsoft Immersive Reader. This gives you a cleaner, more focused view of the math content.

In Immersive Reader, you can adjust text size, use text-to-speech to hear the equation read aloud, and use other reading tools.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Students working with math problems online
- People who find math equations hard to read on busy webpages
- Anyone who wants to hear math problems read aloud
- People with dyscalculia who benefit from clearer math presentation
- Anyone who needs a distraction-free view of math content

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Math Reader

Look through the list of features until you see **Math Reader**.

It has a calculator icon next to it.

Click on **Math Reader** to start using it.

---

## Step 4: Select the Math Area

After clicking Math Reader, a message will appear saying **Drag to Select an Area on the Screen**.

Your cursor will change to a crosshair. Click and drag to draw a rectangle around the math problem or equation you want to extract.

Try to select just the math content, avoiding extra text or images.

---

## Step 5: View in Immersive Reader

After you select the area, Helperbird will process the math content.

The equation will automatically open in Microsoft Immersive Reader. Here you can:

- Increase the text size for easier reading
- Use text-to-speech to hear the math read aloud
- Change the background color and font
- Use other Immersive Reader features

**Tip:** Math Reader works best when you select a clear area around the math problem. If the result is not correct, try selecting a larger or smaller area around the equation.
