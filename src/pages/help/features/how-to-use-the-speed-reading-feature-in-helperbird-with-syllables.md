## What is Speed Reading?

Speed Reading displays one word at a time in the center of your screen. This technique helps you read faster because your eyes do not have to move across the page.

You can adjust how many words appear per minute and add helpful features like syllable breakdown for difficult words.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who want to read faster
- Anyone who gets distracted by other text on the page
- Students who need to get through reading material quickly
- People with attention difficulties who benefit from focused presentation
- Anyone who wants to try rapid serial visual presentation

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Speed Reading

Look through the list of features until you see **Speed Reading**.

It has a speedometer icon next to it.

Click on **Speed Reading** to open it.

---


## Step 4: Select Text and Start

First, highlight the text you want to speed read on the webpage. Click and drag your mouse to select a passage.

A Speed Reading panel will appear showing one word at a time in large text.

---


## Step 5: Control Playback

Use the controls in the Speed Reading panel:

- **Play button** – Start displaying words
- **Pause button** – Stop the display
- **Left arrow** – Go back one word
- **Right arrow** – Go forward one word

Previous and upcoming words appear in smaller boxes below the main word so you have context.

---


## Step 6: Customize Settings

Click the **Settings** button to adjust your speed reading experience:

- **Speed** – Use the slider to adjust reading speed in WPM (words per minute). Higher numbers mean faster reading.

- **Anchor** – When turned on, this highlights the middle letter of each word to help maintain focus.

- **Show Phonics** – When turned on, words are broken into syllables for easier pronunciation.

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

**Tip:** Start with a slower speed like 100-200 WPM if you are new to speed reading, then gradually increase as you get comfortable. The phonics feature is especially helpful for unfamiliar or complex words.
