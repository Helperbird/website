## What is Speed Reading?

Speed reading is a technique that allows you to read text more quickly by flashing individual words or small groups of words on the screen in rapid succession. 

This method minimizes the time your eyes spend moving from one word to the next, helping you process and understand the text more efficiently.

 It can be especially useful when you want to absorb large amounts of information quickly without losing comprehension.
