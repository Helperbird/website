Helperbird's Speed Reading feature helps you read faster by displaying one word at a time at your chosen speed. This technique reduces eye movement and helps you focus on each word.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Find Speed Reading

Scroll down in the list of tools to find **Speed Reading**. It has a speedometer icon. Click the open icon next to it.

---

## Step 3: Use Speed Reading

**Start Speed Reading:**

Highlight the text you want to speed read on the webpage. A Speed Reading panel will appear showing one word at a time in large text.

**Control Playback:**

Use the pink play button to start reading and the pause button to stop. The left and right arrow buttons let you navigate backward or forward through the text one word at a time. Previous and upcoming words appear in smaller boxes below the main word for context.

**Customize Settings:**

Click the **Settings** button to adjust your speed reading experience:

- **Speed**: Use the slider to adjust reading speed in WPM (words per minute)
- **Anchor**: Toggle on to highlight the middle letter of each word to help maintain focus
- **Show Phonics**: Toggle on to break words into syllables for easier pronunciation

Click **Save** to apply your changes.



**Tip:** Start with a slower speed like 100-200 WPM if you're new to speed reading, then gradually increase as you get comfortable. The phonics feature is especially helpful for unfamiliar or complex words.
