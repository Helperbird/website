## What is Saturation?

Saturation controls how vivid or muted the colors appear on a website. You can reduce saturation to make colors less intense, or even turn a page completely grayscale (black and white). This can help reduce visual distractions and make reading easier.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find bright colors distracting or overwhelming
- Anyone with light sensitivity or visual processing difficulties
- People who want to reduce eye strain while reading
- Anyone who prefers a simpler, less colorful display
- People with certain types of color blindness who find grayscale easier

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Saturation

Look through the list of features until you see **Saturation**.

---

## Step 4: Turn on Saturation

Click the toggle switch next to **Saturation** to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 5: Adjust the Level

Once Saturation is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to adjust the saturation level:

- Slide to the left to reduce color intensity (more grayscale)
- Slide to the right to increase color vibrancy

The changes apply to the page immediately so you can see the effect in real time.

**Tip:** If you find colorful websites overwhelming, try reducing saturation to around 50% for a calmer reading experience. Set it to 0% for a fully grayscale page.
