## What is Letter Spacing?

Letter spacing adds extra space between each letter in the text. Instead of letters being close together, they are spread out more.

For example, the word "hello" with increased letter spacing would look like "h e l l o" with small gaps between each letter.

This can make text much easier to read because the letters do not blend together.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who find tightly spaced letters hard to read
- Anyone who experiences visual crowding when reading
- People with visual stress or eye strain
- Students who struggle to distinguish between similar letters like "b" and "d"
- Anyone who finds spread-out text easier to read

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

Make sure the **Text** tab is selected. This is where you will find the letter spacing option.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Letter Spacing

In the Text tab, scroll down until you see **Letter spacing**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Spacing

Once Letter spacing is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to increase the space between letters. Drag it to the left to decrease the spacing.

The changes will apply to the website immediately, so you can see the effect as you adjust the slider.

**Tip:** Start with a small increase. Even a little extra space between letters can make a big difference in readability. Too much spacing can make words harder to recognize, so find the balance that works best for you.
