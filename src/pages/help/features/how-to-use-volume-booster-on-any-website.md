## What is Volume Booster?

Volume Booster amplifies the audio on any webpage beyond the normal 100% maximum. If a video or audio file is too quiet even at full volume, Volume Booster can make it louder so you can hear it clearly.

---

## Who is This For?

Volume Booster is helpful for people with hearing difficulties who need louder audio, anyone watching videos with low audio quality, users in noisy environments, people whose device speakers aren't loud enough, and anyone who finds certain websites have quieter audio than others.

---

## How to Enable Volume Booster

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension menu.

---

### Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the **All Features** section and expand it to see all available features.

---

### Step 3: Find Volume Booster

Look for the **Volume Booster** option in the Media section. Click on it to open the settings panel.

---

### Step 4: Adjust the Volume

Use the slider to increase the volume beyond 100%. You can boost audio up to 200% or higher depending on your needs.

**Tip:** Start with a moderate boost and increase gradually. Very high volume levels may cause audio distortion.

---

## Using Volume Booster

Once enabled, the volume boost applies to all audio and video on the current page. If you navigate to a new page, the boost will continue to apply.

To return to normal volume, simply move the slider back to 100% or turn off the Volume Booster toggle.

---

## Important Notes

**Protect Your Hearing:** Very loud audio can damage your hearing over time. Use Volume Booster responsibly and avoid extremely high levels for extended periods.

**Audio Quality:** Boosting volume beyond 100% may cause some distortion, especially on audio that was already recorded at low quality.
