Once the Volume Booster is turned on, you'll see a slider appear below the toggle switch. This slider allows you to adjust the volume boost percentage.

To reset the volume to the normal level, simply drag the slider back to 100% or turn off the Volume Booster toggle.

Please be cautious with high volume levels, especially when using headphones, as they can harm your hearing.
