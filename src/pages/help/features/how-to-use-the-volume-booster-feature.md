Helperbird's Volume Booster lets you increase audio volume beyond your device's maximum level, making it easier to hear videos, music, and other media on webpages.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Find Media Options

Scroll down in the list of tools to find **Media Options**. It has a picture frame icon. Click the open icon next to it.

---

## Step 3: Use Volume Booster

The Media Options panel will open. Make sure you're on the **Media** tab at the top. Find **Volume booster** and toggle it on.

Once enabled, use the slider to adjust the volume boost level. 

Drag the slider left to decrease or right to increase the volume. The percentage shows your current boost level. You can boost volume up to 600% of the original level.

The volume change applies immediately to any playing media on the page.

*Tip:* Be cautious with high volume levels, especially when using headphones, as they can harm your hearing. Start with a lower boost and gradually increase if needed.
