## What is Volume Booster?

Volume Booster increases the audio volume beyond what the website normally allows. Even when a video is at maximum volume and it is still too quiet, Volume Booster can make it louder.

You can increase volume up to 600% of the original level.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with hearing difficulties who need louder audio
- Anyone watching videos that have quiet audio
- People in noisy environments who need to hear over background noise
- Anyone whose device speakers are too quiet
- People who struggle to hear spoken content

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Media Options

Look through the list of features until you see **Media options**.

---

## Step 4: Open Media Options

Click on **Media options** to open it.

A panel will appear showing the media-related settings you can adjust.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Volume Booster

In the Media options panel, look for **Volume booster**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Volume

Once Volume booster is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to increase the volume. The percentage shows how much the volume is boosted above the normal maximum.

- 100% means normal maximum volume
- 200% means twice as loud as normal
- 600% means six times as loud as normal

The volume change applies immediately to any audio or video on the page.

**Warning:** Be careful with very high volume levels, especially when using headphones. Very loud audio can damage your hearing. Start with a small increase and gradually adjust until you can hear comfortably.
