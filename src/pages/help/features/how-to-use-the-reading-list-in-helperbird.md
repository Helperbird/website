## What is the Reading List?

The Reading List lets you save webpages to read later. When you find an interesting article or page but do not have time to read it now, you can add it to your reading list. You can then come back and access all your saved pages whenever you are ready.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Anyone who finds interesting content but does not have time to read it immediately
- Students researching topics and collecting resources
- People who like to organize their reading material
- Anyone who wants a simple way to save pages without creating bookmarks
- Researchers gathering articles for later review

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Reading List

Look through the list of features until you see **Reading list**.

---

## Step 4: Add a Page to Your List

When you are on a page you want to save, click the **Add** button next to Reading list.

The current page will be saved to your reading list. You will see a confirmation that the page was added.

---

## Step 5: View Your Reading List

To see all your saved pages, click the **View** button next to Reading list.

A panel will open showing all the pages you have saved. Click on any page to open it.

You can also remove pages from your reading list when you have finished reading them.

**Tip:** Use the Reading List to collect all the articles you want to read for a project or topic, then work through them when you have time.
