Helperbird's PDF Reader lets you add text boxes and annotations directly to any PDF. Write notes, add comments, and save your annotated PDF to download or share.

---

## Step 1: Open PDF in Helperbird

When viewing any PDF in your browser, look for the green button that says "Open PDF in Helperbird - Click to Open" or "Open this PDF in Helperbird". Click this button.

The PDF will open in Helperbird's PDF Reader with a clean interface showing the document and navigation tools at the top.



---

## Step 2: Enable Annotation Mode

In the toolbar at the top of the PDF Reader, click the pen icon to activate **Annotation Mode**. 

When annotation mode is active, you'll see "Annotation Mode" displayed in pink below the toolbar, and a message saying "Click anywhere on the page to add a text box" will appear at the top of the document.


---

## Step 3: Add Text Boxes

Click anywhere on the PDF page where you want to add a text box. A white text box will appear at that location.

Type your text inside the box. The text box will expand as you type. You can add as many text boxes as you need by clicking different areas of the PDF.

---

## Step 4: Access Download Options

When you're finished adding your annotations, click the **Download PDF** button (download icon with arrow) in the toolbar at the top.

An Options menu will appear with three download choices:

- **Download Note**: Save just your annotations as a separate file
- **Download PDF**: Download the original PDF without any annotations
- **Download PDF with Annotations**: Download the PDF with all your text boxes included

## Step 5: Download Your Annotated PDF

Click **Download PDF with Annotations**. A green notification will appear confirming "PDF downloaded with annotations".

Your browser will download the annotated PDF. The file will include all your text boxes permanently embedded in the document. You can now share this annotated PDF with others.


**Tip:** Your annotations are saved as part of the PDF, so anyone who opens the file in any PDF reader will see your text boxes. This makes it perfect for adding comments, notes, or feedback to documents.
