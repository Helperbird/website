## What are PDF Annotations?

PDF Annotations let you add text boxes directly onto PDF documents. You can write notes, add comments, or fill in forms. The annotations become part of the PDF and can be saved and shared.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Students who want to add notes to study materials
- Anyone who needs to fill out PDF forms
- People who want to add comments to documents for review
- Researchers who need to annotate academic papers
- Anyone who wants to mark up PDF documents

## Step 1: Open a PDF in Helperbird

When you view any PDF in your browser, look for the green button that says **"Open PDF in Helperbird - Click to Open"** at the bottom of the page.

Click this button.

The PDF will open in Helperbird's PDF Reader with a clean interface and navigation tools at the top.

---

## Step 2: Enable Annotation Mode

In the toolbar at the top of the PDF Reader, click the **pen icon** to activate Annotation Mode.

When annotation mode is active, you will see "Annotation Mode" displayed in pink below the toolbar. A message will also appear saying "Click anywhere on the page to add a text box".

---

## Step 3: Add Text Boxes

Click anywhere on the PDF page where you want to add a text box.

A white text box will appear at that location. Type your text inside the box. The text box will expand as you type.

You can add as many text boxes as you need by clicking different areas of the PDF.

---

## Step 4: Download Your Annotated PDF

When you are finished adding your annotations, click the **Download PDF** button (download icon with arrow) in the toolbar at the top.

An Options menu will appear with three choices:

- **Download Note** – Save just your annotations as a separate file
- **Download PDF** – Download the original PDF without any annotations
- **Download PDF with Annotations** – Download the PDF with all your text boxes included

Click **Download PDF with Annotations**.

A green notification will confirm "PDF downloaded with annotations". Your browser will download the annotated PDF with all your text boxes permanently embedded.

**Tip:** Your annotations are saved as part of the PDF, so anyone who opens the file in any PDF reader will see your text boxes. This makes it perfect for adding comments, notes, or feedback to documents.
