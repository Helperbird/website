## What is Grammar/Spell Check?

Grammar/Spell Check helps you find and fix errors in your writing. It analyzes your text and identifies spelling mistakes and grammar problems.

You can also listen to your text read aloud to help catch errors you might miss when reading silently.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who struggle with spelling
- Students who want to check their writing
- Anyone who wants to improve their grammar
- People learning English as a second language
- Anyone who wants to proofread their text

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Grammar Check

Look through the list of features until you see **Grammar**.

Click on **Grammar** to open it.

A panel will appear with a text area where you can enter or paste your text.

---


## Step 4: Enter Your Text

You can add text to check in two ways:

- **Type or paste** text directly into the text area
- **Select text** on a webpage first, then open Grammar Check. The selected text will appear automatically.

---


## Step 5: Check Your Text

Click the **Check** button to analyze your text for errors.

The tool will show any spelling or grammar problems it finds.

Additional options:

- **Listen** – Hear your text read aloud using text-to-speech
- **Options** – Customize checking settings
- **Clear** – Remove the text and start over
- **Copy** – Copy the corrected text to your clipboard

**Tip:** Use the Listen feature to hear your text read aloud. Hearing your writing can help you catch errors you might miss when reading silently.
