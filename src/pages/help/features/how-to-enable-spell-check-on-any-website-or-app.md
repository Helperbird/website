## Step 3: Check Your Text

To check text for grammar and spelling errors:

1. **Highlight** the text you want to check on any webpage
2. The Grammar/Spell Check popup will appear with your selected text
3. Click the **Check** button to analyze the text
4. Click **Options** to customize checking settings
