## What is Auto Scroll?

Auto Scroll automatically scrolls web pages at a steady pace you control. Instead of manually scrolling, the page moves on its own while you read. You can adjust the speed to match your reading pace.

This is a Helperbird Pro feature.

---

## Who is This For?

Auto Scroll is helpful for people who want hands-free reading, those with motor difficulties that make scrolling uncomfortable, readers who prefer a consistent reading pace, anyone reading long articles or documents, and people using text-to-speech who want the page to follow along.

## How to Enable Auto Scroll

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension menu.

---

### Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the **All Features** section and expand it to see all available features.

---

### Step 3: Find Auto Scroll

Look for the **Auto Scroll** option in the features list. Click on it to open the settings panel.

---

### Step 4: Turn It On

Toggle the Auto Scroll switch to enable it. The toggle will turn GREEN when enabled. The page will start scrolling automatically.

---

## Adjusting Scroll Speed

Once Auto Scroll is enabled, you can adjust the speed using the slider in the settings panel. Move the slider left for slower scrolling or right for faster scrolling. Find the speed that matches your reading pace.

**Tip:** Start with a slower speed and gradually increase it until you find what's comfortable for you.

---

## Stopping Auto Scroll

To stop scrolling, simply toggle the Auto Scroll switch off, or scroll manually with your mouse or trackpad—this will pause the automatic scrolling.
