## What are Link and Image Descriptions?

This feature shows hidden information about links and images when you hover over them. Many links have title text that describes where they lead, and images often have alt text that describes what the image shows. This feature displays that information in a tooltip so you can see it easily.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who want to know where a link leads before clicking
- Anyone who wants to understand images without seeing them clearly
- People with visual impairments who use screen magnification
- Anyone researching or fact-checking content
- People who want more context about links and images on a page

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Link & Image Descriptions

Look through the list of features until you see **Link & Image Descriptions**.

---

## Step 4: Turn on the Feature

Click the toggle switch next to **Link & Image Descriptions** to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 5: Hover Over Links and Images

Move your mouse over any link or image on the page.

A small tooltip will appear showing:

- For links: The title or destination of the link
- For images: The alt text description of the image

This helps you understand what links and images are about before interacting with them.

**Tip:** This feature is especially useful on pages with many links, helping you decide which ones are worth clicking.
