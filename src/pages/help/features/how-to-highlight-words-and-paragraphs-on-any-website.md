## What is the Highlighter?

The Highlighter lets you mark text on any website with colored highlights, just like using a highlighter pen on paper. The highlights stay visible while you are on the page.

You can use different colors to organize information or mark important points.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Students studying and taking notes from online content
- Anyone who wants to mark important information while reading
- People doing research who need to track key points
- Anyone who learns better by marking up text
- People who want to organize information by color

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Enable the Highlight Menu

Look through the list of features until you see **Highlight menu**.

Click the toggle switch next to **Highlight menu** to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

Now when you select text on any webpage, a small toolbar will appear near your selection.

---


## Step 4: Select Text to Highlight

Go to any webpage and use your mouse to select the text you want to highlight. Click and drag to highlight a word, sentence, or paragraph.

A small toolbar will appear near your selected text with several options.

---


## Step 5: Choose a Color

In the toolbar that appears, click the **Highlighter** button.

A color palette will appear. Click on the color you want to use.

The text you selected will immediately be highlighted in that color.

You can select more text and highlight it in the same or different colors.

**Tip:** Use different colors to organize your highlights. For example, use yellow for main ideas, green for definitions, and pink for things you want to review later.
