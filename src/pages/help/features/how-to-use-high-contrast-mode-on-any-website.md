## What is High Contrast Mode?

High Contrast Mode increases the contrast between text and backgrounds on any website. This makes text stand out more clearly, which can be especially helpful for people with low vision or anyone who finds regular websites hard to read.

This is a Helperbird Pro feature.

---

## Who is This For?

High Contrast Mode is helpful for people with low vision or visual impairments, users with light sensitivity, anyone who struggles to read light gray text on white backgrounds, people working in bright environments where screen glare is an issue, and users who prefer stronger visual distinction between elements.

## How to Enable High Contrast Mode

### Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in the top right corner of your browser to open the extension menu.

---

### Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the **All Features** section and expand it to see all available features.

---

### Step 3: Find High Contrast

Look for the **High Contrast** option. Click on it to open the settings panel.

---

### Step 4: Turn It On

Toggle the High Contrast switch to enable it. The toggle will turn GREEN when enabled. The page will immediately display with enhanced contrast.

## Contrast Options

Helperbird offers different high contrast themes to suit your preferences:

**Increased Contrast** - Boosts the existing contrast without changing colors dramatically.

**Inverted Colors** - Swaps light and dark colors for a dark mode-like effect.

**Yellow on Black** - Yellow text on a black background, often preferred for low vision.

**Green on Black** - Green text on black, another popular accessibility option.

Select the option that works best for your eyes.

## Combining with Other Features

High Contrast Mode works well with other Helperbird features. Try combining it with larger text sizes, different fonts, or increased letter spacing for an even more comfortable reading experience.
