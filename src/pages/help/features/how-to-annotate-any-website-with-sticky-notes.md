## What are Sticky Notes?

Sticky Notes let you add digital notes to any website or PDF. They work just like real sticky notes that you would put on a document, except they stay attached to the webpage.

You can add titles, write content, and use different colors to organize your notes.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- Students who want to take notes while reading online
- Researchers who need to annotate web articles
- Anyone who wants to save reminders on specific web pages
- People who learn better by writing things down
- Anyone who needs to organize information from websites

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Sticky Note

Look through the list of features until you see **Sticky note**.

It has a note icon next to it.

---

## Step 4: Create a Sticky Note

Click the **plus (+)** button next to **Sticky note**.

A new sticky note will appear on the page. You can drag it to any position on the webpage.

---

## Step 5: Customize Your Note

On your sticky note:

1. Click the **Title** field at the top and add a title for your note
2. Click in the text area below to write your note content
3. Choose a **color** from the palette at the bottom to change the note's appearance
4. Click the **X** in the corner when you want to delete it

You can create multiple sticky notes on the same page. Use different colors to organize them by category or priority.

**Tip:** Your sticky notes are saved and will appear again when you revisit the same webpage.
