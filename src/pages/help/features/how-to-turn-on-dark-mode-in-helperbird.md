## What is Dark Mode?

Dark Mode changes websites to use dark colors instead of bright white backgrounds. This makes websites easier on your eyes, especially when browsing in low-light conditions or at night.

Dark Mode inverts the colors on websites so that light areas become dark and dark text becomes light.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who browse at night or in dimly lit rooms
- Anyone who finds bright screens uncomfortable
- People who experience eye strain from light backgrounds
- Anyone who prefers dark-themed interfaces
- People who want to reduce screen brightness

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Dark Reader

Look through the list of features until you see **Dark reader**.

It has a moon icon next to it.

---


## Step 4: Open Dark Reader Settings

Click on **Dark reader** to open it.

A settings panel will appear with options to configure Dark Mode.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Dark Mode

In the Dark Reader panel, you will see a toggle switch at the top.

Click the toggle switch to turn Dark Mode **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

The current webpage will immediately switch to a dark color scheme.

---


## Step 6: Customize Settings

You can adjust how Dark Mode looks using the sliders in the panel:

- **Brightness** – Adjust how bright or dim the dark theme appears

- **Contrast** – Change the difference between light and dark elements

- **Grayscale** – Add a grayscale effect to reduce color intensity

- **Sepia** – Add a warm sepia tone to the dark theme

Experiment with these settings to find what is most comfortable for your eyes.

**Tip:** Dark Mode works great when combined with the Reduce Motion feature if you also want a calmer browsing experience.
