Want to reduce eye strain while browsing? Helperbird's Dark Mode transforms your interface into a comfortable dark theme, perfect for late-night work or low-light environments.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension dashboard. You'll see all your tool categories and quick access buttons.


---

## Step 2: Go to Accessibility

Scroll down to find **Accessibility** in the menu and click the **Open** button or click on the Accessibility option to open its settings panel.


---

## Step 3: Enable Dark Mode

In the Accessibility panel, find the **Dark Mode** toggle and turn it on. The toggle will switch to blue, and Helperbird's interface will immediately change to a dark theme, reducing brightness and eye strain.

You'll also see other accessibility options in this panel:
- **Reduce Motion**: Minimizes animations and motion effects
- **Shortcuts**: Enables keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation
- **Print**: Quick access to print options



*Tip: Dark Mode is especially helpful during evening hours or in dimly lit rooms. Combine it with Reduce Motion if you're sensitive to screen animations.*
