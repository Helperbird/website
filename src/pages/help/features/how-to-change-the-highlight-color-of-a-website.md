## What is Highlight Color?

The highlight color feature changes the color that appears when you select text on a website. Normally when you click and drag to select text, it shows with a blue highlight. With Helperbird, you can change this to any color you prefer.

This is the selection highlight you see while reading, not the permanent highlighter tool for annotating.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who find the default blue selection color hard to see
- Anyone who wants better contrast when selecting text
- People with visual preferences for certain colors
- Students who select text frequently while reading
- Anyone who wants to personalize their browsing experience

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---


## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

---


## Step 5: Go to the Colors Tab

Click on the **Colors** tab to see all the color options.

This is where you will find the highlight color option along with other color settings.

---


## Step 6: Turn on Highlight Color

In the Colors tab, look for **Highlight**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 7: Choose Your Color

Once Highlight is turned on, a color palette will appear below the toggle.

Click on any color to select it. Now when you select text on any website, it will be highlighted in your chosen color.

If you do not see a color you like, you can click the color picker icon to choose any custom color.

**Tip:** Choose a color that contrasts well with the text and background colors you are using. A bright yellow or light green often works well for most backgrounds.
