## What is Text to Speech?

Text to Speech reads text out loud using a computer voice. Instead of reading text with your eyes, you can listen to it being spoken.

Helperbird can read an entire webpage, just the text you have highlighted, or custom text that you type or paste.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who find listening easier than reading
- Anyone who wants to multitask while consuming content
- People with visual impairments
- Students who learn better by listening
- Anyone who prefers auditory learning

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Text to Speech

Look through the list of features until you see **Text to Speech**.

Click on **Text to Speech** to open it.

A panel will appear with a text area and playback controls.

---


## Step 4: Play the Text

There are several ways to use Text to Speech:

- **Read the whole page** – If you have not highlighted any text, click the play button. Helperbird will read all the text on the current page.

- **Read selected text** – First, highlight the text you want to hear by clicking and dragging your mouse over it. Then click the play button. Helperbird will read only the highlighted text.

- **Read custom text** – Type or paste text into the text box in the panel. Click the play button to hear that text read aloud.

To stop the audio, click the pause or stop button.

---


## Step 5: Customize Settings

Click the **Settings** tab to adjust how the text is read:

- **Voice** – Choose from different voices. You can select male or female voices in various accents.

- **Speed** – Adjust how fast or slow the voice speaks. A slower speed is good for learning, while a faster speed helps you get through content quickly.

- **Pitch** – Change how high or low the voice sounds.

- **Highlight Color** – As text is read, it can be highlighted on the page. Choose the color for this highlight so you can follow along.

**Tip:** You can also highlight text on any webpage, then use the Highlight Menu that appears to quickly access Text to Speech for that selected text.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why isn't Text to Speech working?**
First, check that your device volume is not muted. Also check that the browser tab isn't muted (look for a speaker icon in the tab). If it still doesn't work, try refreshing the page or restarting your browser.

**Can I use Text to Speech offline?**
Some voices require an internet connection to work. If you're offline, only local system voices will be available.

**How do I change the voice language?**
In the Settings tab, look through the available voices. Voices are named by language and accent (e.g., "English (US)", "English (UK)", "Spanish").

**Does Text to Speech work on PDFs?**
Yes! Open the PDF in Helperbird's PDF reader and you can use Text to Speech on the document content.

**Can I use keyboard shortcuts?**
Yes, you can use keyboard shortcuts to control playback. Check the Helperbird settings for the available shortcuts.
