Helperbird's Text to Speech feature reads any text aloud, letting you listen to articles, documents, or any written content on the web. You can listen to the entire page, just highlighted text, or type your own text.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.


---

## Step 2: Go to Text to Speech

In the list of tools, find **Text to Speech** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Use Text to Speech

A panel will open with a text box and playback controls. Here's how it works:

**Reading Options:**

- **No text highlighted**: Click play to read all the text on the current page
- **Text highlighted**: Click play to read only the highlighted text
- **Custom text**: Type or paste your own text into the text box to have it read aloud

**Playback Controls:**

Choose a voice from the dropdown menu, then click the play button to start listening. Click pause to stop playback at any time.

**Settings:**

Click the **Settings** button to customize your listening experience with options for highlight color, reading speed, and pitch.

**Alternative Access:**

You can also access Text to Speech by highlighting text on any page and clicking the play button in the toolbar that appears, or by right-clicking selected text and choosing **Helperbird > Play**.

**Tip:** Adjust the reading speed and pitch to match your preference. A slower speed is helpful for learning or complex material, while faster speeds let you consume content more quickly. The color setting changes the highlight color that follows along as text is read.
