## What is Text Color?

The text color feature lets you change the color of all text on a website. Instead of reading black text on white, you can choose any color that is more comfortable for your eyes.

This can help reduce eye strain and make reading easier, especially if you are sensitive to certain color combinations.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with visual stress who find certain colors easier to read
- Anyone who experiences eye strain from black text on white backgrounds
- People with dyslexia who benefit from specific color combinations
- Anyone who wants to customize how websites look
- People who read for long periods and want to reduce fatigue

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

---

## Step 5: Go to the Colors Tab

Click on the **Colors** tab to see all the color options.

This is where you will find the text color option along with other color settings.

---

## Step 6: Turn on Text Color

In the Colors tab, look for **Text**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 7: Choose Your Color

Once Text is turned on, a color palette will appear below the toggle.

Click on any color to select it. The text color on the website will change immediately so you can see how it looks.

If you do not see a color you like, you can click the color picker icon to choose any custom color.

**Tip:** Try pairing a custom text color with a custom background color for the best results. For example, cream-colored text on a dark blue background, or dark text on a soft pastel background.
