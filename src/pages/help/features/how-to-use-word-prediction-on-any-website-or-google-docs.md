Helperbird's Word Prediction feature suggests words as you type, helping you write faster and more accurately. It supports multiple languages and works across websites, Google Docs, and more.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Find Writing Tools

In the list of tools, find **Writing Tools** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Use Word Prediction

The Writing Tools panel will open. Find **Word Prediction** and toggle it on.

**Select Your Language:**

Under the Languages section, choose which language you want to use for word predictions. Options include English, French, German, and Spanish. The selected language will have a green checkmark.

**Start Typing:**

Once enabled, start typing in any text field on a webpage or in Google Docs. 

A bar will appear at the bottom of the screen showing word suggestions based on what you've typed. Click any suggestion to insert it into your text. 

Each suggestion also has a speaker icon you can click to hear the word pronounced.


**Tip:** Word Prediction learns from your typing patterns and becomes more accurate the more you use it. The suggestions appear in real-time as you type, so you can quickly select the word you need without finishing typing it.
