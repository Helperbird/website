## What is Word Prediction?

Word Prediction suggests words as you type. When you start typing a word, Helperbird shows you a list of words that you might be trying to write. You can click on a suggestion to insert it instead of typing the whole word.

This helps you write faster and also helps with spelling, since you can see the correct spelling before you finish typing.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who struggle with spelling
- Anyone who wants to type faster
- People with motor difficulties who want to reduce keystrokes
- Students writing essays or assignments
- Anyone learning to spell in a new language

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Word Prediction

Look through the list of features until you see **Word Prediction**.

Click on **Word Prediction** to open its settings panel.

---

## Step 4: Turn on Word Prediction

In the Word Prediction panel, you will see a toggle switch at the top.

Click the toggle switch to turn Word Prediction **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 5: Adjust Settings

You can customize Word Prediction with these options:

**Word Prediction Words Amount** – Use the slider to choose how many word suggestions appear as you type. You can choose between 2 and 8 suggestions.

**Language** – Click on the language you will be typing in. Options include English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. A green checkmark will appear next to your selected language.

---

## Step 6: Start Typing

Now go to any text field on a website or in Google Docs and start typing.

As you type, a bar will appear at the bottom of the screen showing word suggestions. These are words that match what you have typed so far.

To use a suggestion:

- Click on any word to insert it into your text
- Click the speaker icon next to a word to hear how it is pronounced

The suggestions update as you continue typing.

**Tip:** You do not need to finish typing a word. As soon as you see the word you want in the suggestions, just click it. This saves time and helps ensure correct spelling.
