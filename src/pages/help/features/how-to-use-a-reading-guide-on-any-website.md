The Reading Guide adds a solid bar that follows your cursor, helping you stay focused on the line you're reading without losing your place.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Dyslexia Tools

In the list of tools, find **Dyslexia Tools** and click the open icon next to it. Then toggle **Reading Guide** **on**.


---

## Step 3: Customize Reading Guide

In the Dyslexia Tools panel, click the **Settings** tab to customize your reading guide:
- **Height**: Adjust how tall the guide bar appears
- **Width**: Control how wide the guide extends across the screen
- **Color**: Choose a color that contrasts well with the page
- **Brightness**: Make the guide more or less transparent
- **Follow Cursor**: Toggle on to make the guide follow your mouse, or off for a fixed position
- **Position**: Set where the guide appears when Follow Cursor is off


**Tip:** Try using a bright, contrasting color with Follow Cursor enabledâ€”the guide will move with your mouse and act as a handy reading tracker.
