## What is Line Height?

Line height is the vertical space between each line of text. When you increase line height, the lines spread apart more, giving text more breathing room.

For example, a paragraph with increased line height will have larger gaps between each row of text, making it easier to follow from one line to the next without accidentally skipping or rereading lines.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who lose their place between lines
- Anyone who finds tightly packed text difficult to read
- People with visual stress or eye strain
- Students reading long articles or documents
- Anyone who wants text to feel less crowded

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

Make sure the **Text** tab is selected. This is where you will find the line height option.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Line Height

In the Text tab, scroll down until you see **Line height**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Height

Once Line height is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to increase the space between lines. Drag it to the left to decrease the spacing.

The changes will apply to the website immediately, so you can see the effect as you adjust the slider.

**Tip:** Line height works great together with letter spacing and word spacing. If text still feels cramped after adjusting line height, try increasing the other spacing options too.
