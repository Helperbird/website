Helperbird's Highlight Menu gives you instant access to helpful tools whenever you select text on a webpage. Quickly play text aloud, translate, look up definitions, and more with just one click.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

---

## Step 2: Enable Highlight Menu

In the quick actions at the top, find the **Highlight menu** button (the first button with a speech bubble icon) and click it to toggle it on. You'll see a checkmark appear when it's enabled.


---

## Step 3: Use Highlight Menu

Now when you highlight any text on a webpage, a toolbar will appear above your selection with these options:

**Play**: Starts text-to-speech to read the highlighted text aloud

**Stop**: Stops text-to-speech playback

**Dictionary**: Opens a definition for the selected word or phrase

**Search**: Searches the highlighted text using your default search engine

**Immersive**: Opens the selected text in Microsoft's Immersive Reader

**Translate**: Translates the highlighted text to another language

**Highlighter**: Highlights the selected text in your chosen color

**Tip:** The Highlight Menu works on almost any text on the web, making it easy to quickly access Helperbird's tools without opening the main extension panel.
