Control video playback speed and boost volume on any website to customize your viewing experience.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Media Options

Scroll down in the list of tools, find **Media Options** and click the open icon next to it.



---

## Step 3: Adjust Video Controls

In the Media Options panel, you'll see the **Media** tab selected. Here you can control:

- **Video Speed**: Toggle on to enable custom playback speed controls for videos
- **Volume booster**: Toggle on and use the slider to increase volume beyond the video's default maximum (shown as a percentage)


**Tip:** Use Volume booster when videos are too quiet, even at maximum volume. Start with small increments (10-20%) to avoid distortion.
