## What is Video Speed Control?

Video Speed Control lets you change how fast or slow videos play on any website. You can slow down a video to better understand what is being said, or speed it up to get through content faster.

This works on most video players including YouTube, Vimeo, and embedded videos on other websites.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who need more time to process spoken information
- Anyone learning from video tutorials
- Students watching lectures who want to slow down difficult parts
- People who want to speed through familiar content
- Anyone with processing difficulties

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Media Options

Look through the list of features until you see **Media options**.

---


## Step 4: Open Media Options

Click on **Media options** to open it.

A panel will appear showing the media-related settings you can adjust.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Video Speed

In the Media options panel, look for **Video speed**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 6: Adjust the Speed

Once Video speed is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to change the playback speed:

- Slide to the left to slow down the video
- Slide to the right to speed up the video

The speed applies to all videos on the page immediately.

**Tip:** When watching educational content, try slowing the video to 0.75x speed for complex topics. When reviewing content you already know, try 1.5x or 2x speed to save time.
