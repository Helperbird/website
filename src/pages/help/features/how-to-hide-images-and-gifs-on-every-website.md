## What is Hide Images?

The Hide Images feature removes all pictures from a webpage, leaving only the text. The Hide GIFs feature stops animated images from playing.

This helps you focus on reading the actual content without being distracted by pictures or moving images.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who are distracted by images when trying to read
- Anyone sensitive to motion or flashing images
- People with slow internet connections who want pages to load faster
- Students who want to focus on text content
- Anyone who finds animated GIFs overwhelming

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Hide Images or Hide GIFs

Look through the list of features until you see **Hide images** and **Hide GIFs**.

These are separate features in the All Features list. Hide images has a pink image icon and Hide GIFs has a blue GIF icon.

---

## Step 4: Turn on Hide Images or Hide GIFs

Click the toggle switch next to the feature you want to use:

- **Hide images** – Click the toggle to turn it on. This will remove all images from the page, leaving only text content.

- **Hide GIFs** – Click the toggle to turn it on. This will stop animated GIFs from playing on webpages. The images will still appear but they will not move.

The toggles will turn green when enabled. The changes apply immediately to the current page.

You can turn on one or both features depending on what you need.

**Tip:** If you only find the movement distracting but want to see still images, just turn on Hide GIFs. If you want a completely text-only experience, turn on Hide images.
