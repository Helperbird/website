Hide GIFs and images to reduce visual distractions, prevent motion sensitivity issues, or speed up page loading on slower connections.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Media Options

Scroll down in the list of tools, find **Media Options** and click the open icon next to it.

---

## Step 3: Toggle Hide Gifs or Images

In the Media Options panel, you'll see two options:
- **Hide Gifs**: Toggle on to stop animated GIFs from playing on web pages
- **Hide images**: Toggle on to hide all images on web pages, showing only text content

Toggle either or both options on based on your needs.


**Tip:** Use Hide Gifs if moving images are distracting or cause discomfort. Use Hide images when you want to focus purely on text or need pages to load faster.
