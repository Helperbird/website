The Dyslexia Ruler helps you track lines while reading by adding a semi-transparent bar that highlights textâ€”especially helpful for people with dyslexia or anyone who struggles to follow long lines of text.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Dyslexia Tools

In the list of tools, find **Dyslexia Tools** and click the open icon next to it. Then toggle **Dyslexia ruler** **on**.

---

## Step 3: Customize Dyslexia Ruler

In the Dyslexia Tools panel, click the **Settings** tab to customize your ruler:
- **Height**: Adjust how tall the ruler appears
- **Width**: Control how wide the ruler extends across the screen
- **Color**: Choose a color that works best for your eyes
- **Brightness**: Make the ruler more or less transparent
- **Follow Cursor**: Toggle on to make the ruler follow your mouse, or off to keep it in a fixed position
- **Position**: Set where the ruler appears on the screen when Follow Cursor is off


**Tip:** Try enabling Follow Cursor mode and using a light blue or beige color with medium brightness for comfortable line tracking.
