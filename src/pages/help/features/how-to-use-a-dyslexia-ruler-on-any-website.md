## What is the Dyslexia Ruler?

The Dyslexia Ruler is a colored bar that appears on screen to help you focus on one line of text at a time. It works like a physical reading ruler that you might place on a book.

The ruler can follow your mouse cursor as you read, or you can set it to stay in a fixed position. This helps you keep track of where you are and prevents your eyes from jumping to other lines.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who lose their place while reading
- Anyone who finds long lines of text hard to follow
- People with attention difficulties who get distracted by other text
- Students reading dense paragraphs or textbooks
- Anyone who wants help tracking text line by line

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Dyslexia Support

Look through the list of features until you see **Dyslexia support**.

It has a purple icon with a brain symbol on it.

---


## Step 4: Open Dyslexia Support

Click on **Dyslexia support** to open it.

A panel will appear with two tabs at the top: **Tools** and **Settings**.

Make sure the **Tools** tab is selected. This is where you will find the Dyslexia Ruler toggle.

---


## Step 5: Turn on Dyslexia Ruler

In the Tools tab, look for **Dyslexia ruler**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

A colored ruler bar will immediately appear on the screen.

---


## Step 6: Customize the Ruler

To adjust how the ruler looks and behaves, click on the **Settings** tab at the top of the panel.

Here you can change the height, width, color, and other settings to make the ruler work best for you.

---


## Ruler Settings

In the Settings tab, you can customize the following:

- **Height** – Adjust how tall the ruler bar is. A taller ruler covers more lines, while a shorter ruler focuses on a single line.

- **Width** – Control how far the ruler extends across the screen. You can make it cover the full width or just part of the page.

- **Color** – Choose a color for the ruler. Popular choices are light blue, yellow, or beige. Pick a color that is comfortable for your eyes.

- **Brightness** – Make the ruler more or less transparent. Lower brightness lets you see more of the text behind the ruler.

- **Follow Cursor** – When turned on, the ruler moves with your mouse cursor. When turned off, the ruler stays in one place.

- **Position** – When Follow Cursor is off, you can set exactly where the ruler appears on the screen.

**Tip:** Try enabling Follow Cursor mode so the ruler automatically moves to wherever you are reading. Combine this with a soft color like light blue or cream for comfortable reading.
