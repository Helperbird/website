The Focus Ruler combines the best of both worldsâ€”it highlights the line you're reading while dimming everything else on the page, helping you stay focused without distractions.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.



---

## Step 2: Go to Dyslexia Tools

In the list of tools, find **Dyslexia Tools** and click the open icon next to it. Then toggle **Focus ruler** **on**.


---

## Step 3: Customize Focus Ruler

In the Dyslexia Tools panel, click the **Settings** tab to customize your focus ruler:
- **Height**: Adjust how tall the highlighted area appears
- **Width**: Control how wide the focus area extends
- **Color**: Choose the color for the dimmed overlay around your focus area
- **Brightness**: Make the overlay more or less transparent
- **Follow Cursor**: Toggle on to make the focus area follow your mouse, or off to keep it fixed
- **Position**: Set where the focus area appears when Follow Cursor is off


**Tip:** Try enabling Follow Cursor mode with a darker overlay color and medium brightness to create a reading spotlight effect that moves with you.
