## What is Line Focus?

Line Focus (also called Focus Ruler) creates a spotlight effect on the line you are reading. It dims everything on the page except for one strip of text, making it much easier to concentrate.

Think of it like shining a flashlight on just one line while the rest of the page fades into the background. This helps reduce visual clutter and keeps your attention on the text you are reading.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who get distracted by surrounding text
- Anyone with ADHD or attention difficulties
- People who find busy web pages overwhelming
- Students who need to focus while studying
- Anyone who wants to reduce visual distractions while reading

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Dyslexia Support

Look through the list of features until you see **Dyslexia support**.

It has a purple icon with a brain symbol on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Dyslexia Support

Click on **Dyslexia support** to open it.

A panel will appear with two tabs at the top: **Tools** and **Settings**.

Make sure the **Tools** tab is selected. This is where you will find the Line Focus toggle.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Line Focus

In the Tools tab, look for **Focus ruler** (also called Line Focus).

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

The page will immediately dim except for a strip of text where you can focus.

---

## Step 6: Customize the Focus

To adjust how the line focus looks and behaves, click on the **Settings** tab at the top of the panel.

Here you can change the size, color, and behavior of the focus area.

---

## Focus Settings

In the Settings tab, you can customize the following:

- **Height** – Adjust how tall the focused reading area is. Make it taller to see more lines or shorter to focus on just one line.

- **Width** – Control how far across the screen the focus area extends.

- **Color** – Choose the color of the dimmed area around your focus strip. Darker colors create more contrast.

- **Brightness** – Adjust how dark the dimmed area is. Lower brightness makes the surrounding area darker.

- **Follow Cursor** – When turned on, the focus area moves with your mouse. When turned off, it stays in one place.

- **Position** – When Follow Cursor is off, you can set exactly where the focus area appears.

**Tip:** For the best reading experience, turn on Follow Cursor and use a dark overlay color. This creates a spotlight effect that follows your mouse as you read down the page.
