Extract Text uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to pull text from images, screenshots, and PDFs, making it readable, translatable, and saveable.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Configure Extract Text Options

In the list of tools, find **Extract Text** and click the open icon next to it. A settings panel will appear with these options:

- **Immersive Reader**: Toggle on to open extracted text in Microsoft's Immersive Reader for easier reading
- **Translate**: Toggle on to automatically translate the extracted text using Google Translate
- **Listen**: Toggle on to have the extracted text read aloud immediately
- **Save as Note**: Toggle on to save the extracted text as a sticky note on the page
- **Languages**: Select the language of the text you're extracting for better accuracy

Once you've chosen your options, click the **Start** button.

## Step 3: Extract Text from Image

After clicking Start:
1. You'll get a prompt to select an area on the page.
2. **Click and drag** to select the area containing the text you want to extract.
3. Helperbird will show "Looking for Text" as it processes the image.
4. The extracted text will be saved to your clipboard and appear in a popup (if Save as Note is enabled).


**Tip:** For best results, make sure the text in the image is clear and not too small. Extract Text works great on infographics, PDF screenshots, and images with text.
