## What is Auto Scroll?

Auto Scroll makes the page scroll automatically at a steady pace. Instead of manually scrolling with your mouse or keyboard, the page moves down on its own.

You can adjust the speed to match how fast you read.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who want hands-free reading
- Anyone with motor difficulties that make scrolling hard
- People who want to focus on reading without interruptions
- Students reading long articles or documents
- Anyone who prefers a consistent reading pace

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Tools

Look through the list of features until you see **Tools**.

---

## Step 4: Open Tools

Click on **Tools** to open it.

A panel will appear showing various tools you can use.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Auto Scroll

In the Tools panel, look for **Auto scroll**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

The page will immediately start scrolling down automatically.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Speed

Once Auto scroll is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to adjust how fast the page scrolls:

- Slide to the left to scroll slower
- Slide to the right to scroll faster

Find a speed that matches your comfortable reading pace.

**Tip:** Start with a slower speed and increase it as you get used to auto-scrolling. You can click anywhere on the page or press any key to pause the scrolling temporarily.
