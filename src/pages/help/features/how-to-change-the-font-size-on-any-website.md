## What is the Font Size Feature?

Helperbird lets you change the size of text on any website. You can make text larger if it is too small to read comfortably, or make it smaller if you prefer more compact text.

The size change applies to all text on the page instantly. You can adjust it using a simple slider to find the perfect size for you.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with low vision who need larger text
- Anyone who finds website text too small to read comfortably
- People who get eye strain from reading small text
- Students reading long articles or documents online
- Anyone who wants more control over how websites look

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---

## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

Make sure the **Text** tab is selected. This is where you will find the font size option.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Font Size

In the Text tab, look for **Font size**. It has a yellow icon with an "A+" symbol.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Size

Once Font size is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to make text larger, or drag it to the left to make text smaller.

The changes will apply to the website immediately, so you can see the effect as you adjust the slider.

**Tip:** Start with a small adjustment and keep increasing until the text feels comfortable to read. Everyone has different preferences, so take your time to find the size that works best for you.
