## What is Link Color?

The link color feature lets you change the color of all clickable links on a website. Links are the text you click to go to other pages.

By default, links are often blue, but some websites use colors that are hard to see or do not stand out enough. With Helperbird, you can choose any color that makes links easier to find and read.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who have trouble seeing blue or other default link colors
- Anyone with color blindness who needs links to stand out more
- People who find it hard to distinguish links from regular text
- Anyone who wants links to match their custom color scheme
- People who read pages with poor link visibility

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Text Settings

Look through the list of features until you see **Text settings**.

It has a yellow icon with the letter "T" on it.

---


## Step 4: Open Text Settings

Click on **Text settings** to open it.

A panel will appear with three tabs at the top: **Text**, **Colors**, and **Border**.

---


## Step 5: Go to the Colors Tab

Click on the **Colors** tab to see all the color options.

This is where you will find the link color option along with other color settings.

---


## Step 6: Turn on Link Color

In the Colors tab, look for **Link**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 7: Choose Your Color

Once Link is turned on, a color palette will appear below the toggle.

Click on any color to select it. All links on the website will change to your chosen color immediately.

If you do not see a color you like, you can click the color picker icon to choose any custom color.

**Tip:** Choose a color that contrasts well with both the background and regular text. Bright or bold colors like orange, green, or purple often work well for making links stand out.
