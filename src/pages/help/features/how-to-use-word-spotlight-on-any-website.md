## What is Word Spotlight?

Word Spotlight creates a spotlight effect that highlights the area around your cursor as you move it across a webpage. This helps you focus on specific text by making the surrounding content less prominent. It works like shining a flashlight on what you are reading.

---


## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who have difficulty tracking text while reading
- Anyone with attention difficulties like ADHD
- People who get distracted by surrounding content
- Readers who lose their place on busy webpages
- Anyone who wants to focus on one section at a time

---


## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Word Spotlight

Look through the list of features until you see **Word Spotlight**.

---


## Step 4: Turn on Word Spotlight

Click the toggle switch next to **Word Spotlight** to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---


## Step 5: Read with Focus

Move your mouse cursor across the webpage.

A spotlight effect will follow your cursor, highlighting the text near it while dimming the rest of the page. This helps you focus on the content you are currently reading.

Move your cursor down the page as you read to keep the spotlight on the text you are looking at.

**Tip:** Word Spotlight works great with articles and long text content. Combine it with a dyslexia-friendly font or increased text size for an even better reading experience.
