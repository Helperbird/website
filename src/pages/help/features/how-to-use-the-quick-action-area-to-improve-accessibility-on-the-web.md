## What are Quick Actions?

Quick Actions are buttons at the top of the Helperbird menu that give you one-click access to your most-used features. Instead of scrolling through all the features, you can click a Quick Action button to instantly use a tool.

You can customize which features appear in Quick Actions so you have fast access to the tools you use most.

- Anyone who uses certain Helperbird features frequently

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

## Step 2: View Quick Actions

At the top of the Helperbird menu, you will see a row of colorful circular buttons. These are your Quick Actions.

Each button represents a different feature. Default Quick Actions include Highlight Menu, Reading Mode, Immersive Reader, Text to Speech, and more.

## Step 3: Use a Quick Action

Click any Quick Action button to use that feature immediately.

Some buttons toggle a feature on or off (like Highlight Menu). Other buttons open a panel with more options (like Text to Speech or Translate).

## Step 4: Customize Quick Actions

To add or remove features from Quick Actions:

1. Click the **plus (+)** button in the Quick Actions area
2. A menu will appear showing all available features
3. Features with green checkmarks are currently in your Quick Actions
4. Click any feature to add or remove it from Quick Actions
5. Close the menu when you are done

Your changes are saved automatically.

**Tip:** Add the features you use most often to Quick Actions for faster access. You can have as many or as few tools as you want in your Quick Actions area.
