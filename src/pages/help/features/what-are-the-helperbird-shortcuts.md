## What are Keyboard Shortcuts?

Keyboard shortcuts let you quickly activate Helperbird features by pressing key combinations instead of opening the menu and clicking. For example, you could press a few keys to instantly start text-to-speech or turn on Reading Mode.

Shortcuts are disabled by default because some websites have their own keyboard shortcuts that might conflict with Helperbird's.

## Step 4: View All Shortcuts

To see all available keyboard shortcuts, click on **Shortcuts** in the Options panel.

A Keyboard shortcuts panel will appear showing all available shortcuts. Each shortcut shows the feature name and its key combination.

Common shortcuts include:

**Tip:** The shortcuts use the Command key (⌘) on Mac or Control key (Ctrl) on Windows. Start by learning a few shortcuts for features you use most often.
