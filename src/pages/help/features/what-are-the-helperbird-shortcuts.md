Helperbird's keyboard shortcuts let you quickly activate features with simple key combinations, making your browsing more efficient. Shortcuts are disabled by default to avoid conflicts with other websites.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.

## Step 2: Enable Shortcuts

Scroll down to find **Accessibility** and click the open icon next to it. In the Accessibility panel, find **Shortcuts** and toggle it on.

Shortcuts are disabled by default because some websites have their own keyboard shortcuts that might conflict with Helperbird's. Once enabled, you can use keyboard combinations to quickly access Helperbird features.

---

## Step 3: View All Shortcuts

To see all available keyboard shortcuts, click the Helperbird icon at the top left of the extension panel to open the Options menu. Select **Shortcuts** from the menu.

A Keyboard shortcuts panel will appear showing all available shortcuts. 

Each shortcut shows the feature name and its key combination. Common shortcuts include turning Helperbird on/off, activating Word Prediction, opening Reading Mode, and more.


**Tip:** The shortcuts use the Command key (âŒ˜) on Mac or Control key (Ctrl) on Windows. Practice using a few shortcuts for features you use most often to speed up your workflow.
