## What is Highlight Word on Hover?

Highlight Word on Hover adds a colored background to any word your mouse cursor passes over. As you move your mouse across the page, each word lights up as you hover over it.

This acts like a digital finger following along with your reading, making it much easier to track your place on the page.

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People who lose their place while reading
- Anyone who struggles to focus on text
- Students reading long articles or textbooks
- People with dyslexia or attention difficulties
- Anyone who wants visual feedback while reading

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---


## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---


## Step 3: Find Highlight Word

Look through the list of features until you see **Highlight word**.

It has a lightbulb icon next to it.

---


## Step 4: Turn on Highlight Word

Click the toggle switch next to **Highlight word** to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

Now move your mouse over any text on the page. Each word you hover over will be highlighted with a colored background.

**Tip:** This feature works great when combined with other reading tools like the Reading Guide or text-to-speech for maximum focus.
