Helperbird's highlight word feature helps you stay focused while reading by adding a yellow background to whatever word your mouse is hovering over. This makes it easier to track your place on the page and follow along with the text.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Media Options

Scroll down through the Helperbird menu and click on **Media Options** to open the media settings panel.


---

## Step 3: Enable Highlight Word

In the Media Options panel, click on the **Hover** tab at the top. 

Toggle on **Highlight Word** to activate the feature. 

Once enabled, move your mouse over any word on a webpage and it will be highlighted with a yellow background, making it easy to see exactly which word you're looking at.


**Tip:** This feature is especially helpful when reading long articles or documents. It acts like a digital finger, helping you keep your place and maintain focus as you read through the content.
