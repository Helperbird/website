Helperbird's Voice Typing feature lets you speak instead of type, converting your words into text on any website. Perfect for hands-free writing or when you want to capture your thoughts quickly.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.


---

## Step 2: Go to Voice Typing

In the list of tools, find **Voice Typing** and click the open icon next to it.

---

## Step 3: Use Voice Typing

A Voice Typing panel will open with several options:

**Speed dropdown**: Choose between Normal, Fast, or Slow dictation speeds to match your speaking pace.

**Text box**: Your spoken words appear here as you dictate.

**Language selector**: Choose which language you're speaking from the dropdown menu.

**Microphone button** (pink): Click to start recording your voice. Speak clearly into your microphone and your words will appear in the text box. Click again to stop recording.

**Grammar/Spell Check button**: Automatically checks and corrects your dictated text.

**Options button**: Access additional settings for voice typing.

**Listen button**: Plays back your dictated text using text-to-speech.

**Copy button**: Copies your dictated text to the clipboard so you can paste it anywhere.


**Tip:** Speak punctuation marks like "comma," "period," or "question mark" to add them to your text. If you make a mistake, you can either use the Grammar/Spell Check feature or manually edit the text before copying it.
