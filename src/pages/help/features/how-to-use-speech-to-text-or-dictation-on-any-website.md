## What is Voice Typing?

Voice Typing (also called Speech to Text or Dictation) lets you speak into your microphone and have your words automatically typed out as text. Instead of typing on a keyboard, you just talk.

Helperbird converts your speech into written text that you can then copy and paste wherever you need it.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with dyslexia who find typing difficult
- Anyone with motor difficulties that make typing hard
- People who think better when speaking than writing
- Students who want to take notes quickly
- Anyone who wants to write hands-free

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Go to the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Voice Typing

Look through the list of features until you see **Voice Typing**.

Click on **Voice Typing** to open it.

A panel will appear with a text box and recording controls.

---

## Step 4: Select Your Language

Before you start speaking, choose your language from the dropdown menu in the panel.

This tells Helperbird which language you will be speaking so it can recognize your words correctly.

---

## Step 5: Start Speaking

Click the microphone button to start recording. The button may turn pink or show an active indicator.

Speak clearly into your microphone. As you talk, your words will appear in the text box.

When you are done speaking, click the microphone button again to stop recording.

You can also:

- Click **Grammar/Spell Check** to fix any errors in your dictated text
- Click **Listen** to hear your text read back to you
- Adjust the speed setting to match how fast you speak

**Tip:** To add punctuation, you can say the punctuation mark out loud. For example, say "Hello comma how are you question mark" to get "Hello, how are you?"

---

## Step 6: Use Your Text

Once you are happy with your text, click the **Copy** button to copy it to your clipboard.

You can then paste the text anywhere you need it, such as into an email, document, or form field.
