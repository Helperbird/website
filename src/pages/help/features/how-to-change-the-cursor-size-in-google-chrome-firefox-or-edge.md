The Cursor Size feature lets you make your mouse pointer larger, making it easier to see and track as you move around web pages.

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird owl icon in your browser toolbar to open the main dashboard.


---

## Step 2: Go to Display Options

Scroll down in the list of tools, find **Display Options** and click the open icon next to it.


---

## Step 3: Adjust Cursor Size

In the Display Options panel:
1. Toggle **Cursor size** **on**.
2. Use the **slider** to adjust how large you want your cursorâ€”slide right to make it bigger or left to make it smaller.
3. The label shows your current size (Small, Medium, Large, etc.).

**Tip:** A larger cursor is especially helpful on high-resolution displays or when you have trouble tracking the standard pointer.
