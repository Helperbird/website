## What is Cursor Size?

The Cursor Size feature lets you make your mouse pointer larger than normal. A bigger cursor is easier to spot and follow as you move it around the screen.

This replaces the small default cursor with a larger, more visible version.

---

## Who is This For?

This feature is helpful for:

- People with low vision who have trouble seeing the standard cursor
- Anyone who loses track of their cursor on the screen
- People using high-resolution displays where cursors appear small
- Anyone with motor difficulties who needs a larger target
- People who find the default cursor too small

---

## Step 1: Open Helperbird

Click the Helperbird icon in your browser toolbar. It looks like a small owl and is usually in the top-right corner of your browser.

This will open the Helperbird menu.

---

## Step 2: Open the All Features Section

Scroll down to the bottom of the Helperbird menu. You will see a section called **All Features**.

Click the arrow next to **All Features** to expand it and show all available features.

---

## Step 3: Find Display Options

Look through the list of features until you see **Display options**.

---

## Step 4: Open Display Options

Click on **Display options** to open it.

A panel will appear showing various display settings you can adjust.

---

## Step 5: Turn on Cursor Size

In the Display options panel, look for **Cursor size**.

Click the toggle switch next to it to turn it **on**. The toggle will turn green when it is enabled.

---

## Step 6: Adjust the Size

Once Cursor size is turned on, a slider will appear below the toggle.

Drag the slider to the right to make the cursor larger. Drag it to the left to make it smaller.

A label will show you the current size setting (Small, Medium, Large, etc.).

The change happens immediately so you can see the new cursor size right away.

**Tip:** If you have a high-resolution display, you may want to use a larger cursor size. The default cursor can look very tiny on 4K monitors.
