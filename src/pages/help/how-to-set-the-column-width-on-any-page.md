## Using the Paragraph Columns Feature in Helperbird

The Paragraph Columns feature in Helperbird can enhance your reading experience by organizing text into columns, making it easier to follow and read large sections of text on web pages.

### Activating Paragraph Columns

**Step 1**: Click on the Helperbird icon in your browser's toolbar to access the extension's menu.

**Step 2**: Use the built-in search function at the top of the menu to find the "Columns" option quickly.

**Step 3**: Toggle the switch next to "Columns" to the 'On' position to activate the feature.

### Adjusting the Number of Columns

**Step 4**: After enabling Columns, a slider labeled "Columns" will appear. By default, it might be set to '2 columns'.

**Step 5**: Adjust the slider to increase or decrease the number of columns. You can choose to have the text in 2, 3, or more columns as per your preference.

**Step 6**: As you adjust the slider, the text on the page will reflow into the number of columns you have selected, allowing for a customized reading layout.

Keep in mind that the column layout might vary based on the website's design and responsiveness.
