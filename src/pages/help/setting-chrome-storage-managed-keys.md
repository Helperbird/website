## Step 1: Create a JSON Policy File

Create a JSON file that defines the policies you want to set. Your JSON file should look like this:

```json
{
  "subKey": "exampleValue",
  "isExamMode": true,
  "isAdminControl": false
}
```


## Step 2: Upload the JSON Policy File to Google Admin Console

**Sign in to the Google Admin console**:
Go to [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com) and sign in with your administrator account.

**Navigate to Device Management**:
From the Admin console Home page, go to `Devices`.

**Chrome Management**:
Click on `Chrome management`.

**App Management**:

Click on **Apps & extensions**.

**Manage Policies for Extensions**:
Find the extension for which you want to set the policy. If the extension is not already listed, you'll need to add it. Click on the `+` icon to add a new app or extension by ID.

**Upload Custom Policy**:

Once you have located or added the extension, click on it.
Navigate to the **User settings** tab.
Under **Policy for extensions**, youâ€™ll see an option to upload your custom JSON policy file.
Upload the JSON file you created in Step 1.



## Step 3: Apply the Policy

**Save and Apply**:
Save the changes. The policy will be applied to all users under the specified organizational unit.

**Verify Policy Application**:
To verify that the policy has been applied, users can navigate to **chrome://policy** in their Chrome browser. They should see the policies listed under the **Managed Configuration** section.

## Example of Applying Policies

Here's an example of how your managed storage policy might be configured for an extension with ID **ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme**:

```json
{
  "ahmapmilbkfamljbpgphfndeemhnajme": {
    "subKey": "exampleValue",
    "isExamMode": true,
    "isAdminControl": false
  }
}
```


## Additional Tips

**Organizational Units**: Ensure you are applying the policy to the correct organizational unit within your domain.
**Policy Propagation**: Policies can take some time to propagate across all devices. It might require users to restart their Chrome browser or device.
**Debugging**: Use the **chrome://policy** URL to debug and verify the policies applied to Chrome.

By following these steps, you can configure **chrome.storage.managed** keys using the Google Admin Console, ensuring that your Chrome extension receives the specified managed storage settings.
