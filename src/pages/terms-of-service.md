## License

### Intellectual Property Rights
At Helperbird, we take pride in our work. All the materials on Helperbird - be it text, images, software, or anything else - are our exclusive intellectual property or that of our licensors. We hold all the rights to these materials. What this means for you is that you can use Helperbird for your personal, non-commercial purposes, as long as you stick to the terms we’ve set out.

#### Helperbird Pro
This license is tied to one email address. Think of it as your personal Helperbird access pass.

#### Helperbird Pro Unlimited
Ideal for organizations, this license covers an unlimited number of users within your specific domain or school.

#### Helperbird Pro Unlimited +
Designed for larger entities like school districts or enterprises, this license extends to unlimited schools within a district or unlimited sub-businesses within a company.

### Important Notes on Subscription
Sharing your subscription key outside your domain is a big no-no. If it happens, we’ll first give you a warning. If it keeps happening, we might have to cancel your subscription, and unfortunately, a refund won’t be an option.

We’re always working to make Helperbird better, which means sometimes we add [new features](https://www.helperbird.com/updates/), change existing ones, or even remove some. We reserve the right to do this without prior notice. It’s all part of keeping Helperbird dynamic and responsive to our users' needs.




## Age Restrictions
At Helperbird, we're dedicated to making our services accessible to everyone, prioritizing privacy and security. We adhere to the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](/compliance/) and other safety guidelines to ensure a secure environment for all users, especially those under the age of 13. Our [commitment extends](/compliance/) to regularly checking our practices and updating our systems every two weeks to stay in line with compliance laws.

### Accessing Helperbird Features
For our basic Helperbird features, no login is required, which means these tools are readily available for all users without any barriers. This approach ensures ease of access and maintains user privacy from the outset.

### Signing Up for Helperbird Pro
To enjoy the enhanced capabilities of Helperbird Pro, users can sign up at [Helperbird.com](/pricing/). This process involves creating an account with our secure payment processor, Stripe, to ensure a safe and compliant signup experience. For users under 13, we take extra steps, including requiring parental or guardian consent, to meet our safety and compliance standards.

### In-App (Extension) Verification
After registration, within the Helperbird extension itself, you have the option to let us verify the email associated with your browser profile (Google Chrome or Edge). This step is crucial for accessing Helperbird Pro features and is conducted with the utmost respect for your privacy. We do not engage in tracking or storing personal information; our goal is simply to confirm your subscription status.

### Alternative: Subscription Key Method
For those who prefer not to share their browser email, the subscription key method offers a privacy-conscious alternative. This option allows you to access Helperbird Pro features without disclosing your email, aligning with our strong commitment to user privacy and choice.

We continuously strive to ensure our services are compliant with the latest standards, conducting regular reviews and updates to our practices. Whether through email verification in the extension or using a subscription key, our primary aim is to provide a secure, private, and accessible experience for all our users.


## User Responsibilities
It’s not just about us providing services; it's also about how you use them. We trust you to use Helperbird responsibly. This means following laws and regulations, respecting other users, and not engaging in harmful or illegal activities through our service. Let’s keep Helperbird a positive and productive space for everyone!





## Accessibility Statement
At Helperbird, our commitment to accessibility is not just a one-time effort; it's an ongoing journey. We're dedicated to continuously improving both our website and app to ensure they are as accessible as possible to everyone. Our goal is to meet and exceed accessibility standards, but we understand there's always room for growth and improvement.

If you ever encounter a part of Helperbird that isn't meeting these standards, or if you have specific accessibility needs or suggestions, we really want to hear from you. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us enhance our services. Please reach out to us at [support@helperbird.com](/support/) with any observations or ideas. Together, we can make Helperbird an even more inclusive and accessible tool for all.



## Information Accuracy and Availability

At Helperbird, we’re committed to ensuring the information on all our platforms is accurate and current. While we do our best, we can’t guarantee absolute completeness or up-to-the-minute accuracy. We're proud to say that we've maintained a 100% uptime over the last four years, but we understand that unexpected issues can arise.

Even with our diligent efforts, if you spot something that seems off or if you have suggestions for improvements, we'd love to hear from you. Reach out to us at [support@helperbird.com](mailto://support@helperbird.com) with any updates or corrections. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us maintain the high standards we’ve set for Helperbird.

And remember, despite our best efforts and a stellar track record, there might be times when our services are briefly unavailable due to maintenance or unforeseen technical issues. We’re dedicated to minimizing these interruptions and keeping our services running smoothly for you.


Integrating the additional suggested sections into your existing Terms of Service while maintaining the tone will enhance clarity and legal coverage. Here's how these new sections could be woven into your current framework:


## Limitation of Liability

At Helperbird, we're dedicated to delivering top-notch services. However, it's important to understand that Helperbird, along with our affiliates and partners, cannot be held responsible for any losses or damages that may occur as a result of using, or not being able to use, our services. This includes both "direct" damages (like loss of profits) and "indirect" damages (like loss of opportunity).

We continuously work to enhance Helperbird and take measures to prevent issues. But in a complex digital world, sometimes unforeseen challenges arise. If you ever face any problems, please [reach out to us](https://www.helperbird.com). We’re here to help and learn from your experiences to make Helperbird even better.

Remember, our services are designed to assist and enhance your digital experience, but they do have limits. We appreciate your understanding and your trust in us.



## Links on Our Website

We know that the internet is a vast space, and sometimes links on our website might lead to content that you find objectionable or inappropriate. If you come across any such link, please don’t hesitate to let us know at [support@helperbird.com.](mailto://support@helperbird.com) We take your concerns seriously and will review every request we receive.

That said, it's important to remember that we have the final say in whether to take action on any particular link. Also, while we'd love to respond to each concern individually, due to the volume of requests we might not always be able to provide personalized feedback. Rest assured, your input is valuable to us and helps us keep our website a safe and reliable resource for everyone.




## Disclaimer of Warranties
Helperbird is provided “as is,” without any guarantees. We pour our hearts into making it reliable and useful, but we can’t promise it will be perfect for your needs. There might be times when it’s not available, or when features don’t work as expected. We’re always on the job to fix issues, but we can’t legally promise that everything will always work flawlessly. Please do report any bugs to [support](/support/).






## Account Termination/Suspension Policy
Creating your Helperbird Pro account, whether it's for individual use or as an admin, is seamlessly managed through Stripe, our payment processing partner. This setup ensures not only ease of use but also high security for your account information.

While we strive to offer a flexible and user-friendly service, it's crucial to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all our users. If the terms of service are violated, or if there’s misuse of our platform, we may have to take action. This could range from suspending an account to, in severe cases, terminating it.

Such decisions are never taken lightly. They're a last resort, used only when necessary to address serious issues like legal infractions or behavior that's harmful to the community. Our aim is always to keep Helperbird a positive, productive space for everyone.

If you have any questions or concerns about your Helperbird Pro account, be it as an individual user or as an admin, please feel free to reach out. We're here to ensure your experience with Helperbird is as smooth and enjoyable as possible.


## Requests and Suggestions

We love hearing from you! Your ideas and suggestions for making Helperbird better are always welcome. While we read & seriously consider every piece of feedback, please understand that the decision to implement these changes is ultimately up to our team. Also, just a heads up, we handle formal requests, including things like copyright issues, and might do so without letting you know in advance. 

We're committed to continuous improvement and value your input in this journey.



## Changes to Terms of Service
The digital world moves fast, and so do we. We might need to change these terms from time to time to keep up. When we do, we’ll update them here, and we’ll do our best to let you know — but it's also a good idea for you to check back in now and then.

## Indemnification Clause
By using Helperbird, you agree to indemnify us against certain types of legal claims. This means if your actions cause legal issues for us, you’d help cover the costs. It’s a standard clause, but an important one.


## DMCA Compliance
We respect copyright laws and expect our users to do the same. If you believe that your copyright is being infringed on our platform, please reach out to us following our DMCA policy, available [here](/support/).

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

If there's ever a legal issue with our terms and conditions, these matters will be handled according to the laws of Ireland. This means that any legal disputes or issues will be dealt with in Irish courts. We're committed to being as transparent and understandable as possible, so if you have any questions about what this means, please don’t hesitate to contact us.







## Severability and Waiver
If a court finds part of these terms unenforceable, the rest still apply. And just because we don’t enforce a part of these terms right away doesn’t mean we waive our right to do so later.
