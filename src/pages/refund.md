## Full Refunds

If you were inadvertently billed for the next cycle but had plans to end your subscription and reach out within 3 working days, we'll happily process a full refund.

If you overlooked canceling after your 3-day trial and let us know within a week of your subscription's start, we’ll ensure you receive a full refund.

## Partial Refunds or Credits

Should there be significant interruptions in our service, such as several hours of downtime in a day or multiple days within a month, we might extend a partial refund or credit to your account.

Delays in our response time? If we don’t get back to you in a timely manner, we may provide a partial credit to your account.
