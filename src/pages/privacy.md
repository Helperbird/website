## Overview

At Helperbird, your privacy isn't just a priority—it's a commitment. We value and protect your personal data. Here's a rundown of our practices when you use our applications or visit our website:

### No Peeking!
We don’t track, use, or store any personal data on our servers or any third-party ones. Everything is stored locally on your device for settings and educational reasons.
  
### Just Checking!
We request to know your email solely to verify if you've purchased our services through Stripe. Rest assured, it doesn’t get stored anywhere outside of Stripe.

### All About You
Our applications are designed with user privacy in mind. They don’t gather, utilize, or save any of your personal data. Your individual settings remain on your device, and we consider that your private space.

### Fort Knox Standard
We've taken rigorous measures to safeguard your data from mishaps. Our payment gateways are secure, and trusted entities like Google, Firefox, and Microsoft regularly scrutinize our code for malware. Plus, all our employees are equipped with two-step verification for enhanced security.

### Kids are Special 
In line with the Children’s Online Security Protection Act (COPPA & FERPA), we don't collect data from anyone, especially children under the age of 13.

### Permission, Always
Occasionally, we might ask for your email and permission to modify the current webpage. This is strictly to verify your paid status in Stripe and to apply the modifications you desire on the webpage.

### Analytics? Nope 
Your trust is paramount. We don't engage with Google Analytics or any third-party apps. All your data stays local to your device.

## Information Collection and Use

At Helperbird, we are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of all users of our extension – both free and Pro. Here’s how we handle your data with care and respect.


### Zero Tracking Commitment
Whether you're using the free version of Helperbird or have upgraded to Helperbird Pro, we guarantee zero tracking of your activities. Our application is free of any third-party scripts that could compromise your privacy.

### No Personal Data Collection
For free users of Helperbird, rest assured we collect no personal information whatsoever. You can use our services anonymously, with the peace of mind that your privacy is intact.

### Pro User Registration
For Helperbird Pro users, the only time we require information is during the registration and payment process, which is securely facilitated through Stripe. Even then, we do not store your email or any personal data or usesage on our servers. Your email, if provided, is only used to verify your account status with Stripe and to ensure you have a valid subscription. 

#### In-App (Extension) Verification
After registration, within the Helperbird extension itself, you have the option to let us verify the email associated with your browser profile (Google Chrome or Edge). This step is crucial for accessing Helperbird Pro features and is conducted with the utmost respect for your privacy. We do not engage in tracking or storing personal information; our goal is simply to confirm your subscription status.

#### Alternative: Subscription Key Method
For those who prefer not to share their browser email, the subscription key method offers a privacy-conscious alternative. This option allows you to access Helperbird Pro features without disclosing your email, aligning with our strong commitment to user privacy and choice.


### Schools and Businesses
For institutions such as schools and businesses using Helperbird Pro Unlimited or Helperbird Pro Unlimited +, we only require the domain of the email addresses to set up the service. This approach ensures that we do not collect or store full email addresses of individual users, maintaining a high level of privacy.

#### Alternative: Subscription Key Method
For those who prefer not to share their browser email, the subscription key method offers a privacy-conscious alternative. This option allows you to access Helperbird Pro features without disclosing your email, aligning with our strong commitment to user privacy and choice.

## Data Storage and Management

### Local Storage
Helperbird is designed with your privacy as a priority. We do not collect or store any sensitive personal information. The settings and options you customize, such as your preferred font or color settings, are saved locally on your device in the browser's local storage. This means they are kept private to you and are not accessible by us or any third parties.

### Browser Sync Options
For your convenience, if you choose to enable synchronization in Chrome or Edge, your settings such as custom fonts or color options can be synced across devices using the browser’s sync.local storage feature. This sync is managed by your browser and allows you to maintain a consistent Helperbird experience on any device you use. Importantly, even this sync does not involve storing any of your personal data on our servers.

## Data Sovereignty and Third-Party Sharing

In the digital world, your data belongs to you. At Helperbird, we stand by the principle that nothing leaves your browser unless you want it to. We do not collect, store, or sell any personal information or usage data. The only exception is the optional email address for Helperbird Pro users, which is used solely for account verification and subscription management. Our users also have the option to use a subscription key, offering an additional layer of privacy. Our commitment ensures that your experience with Helperbird remains private, secure, and completely under your control.

#### activeTab

**And for the optional permissions:**
These are not used in Firefox & Safrai.

#### identity.email
This optional permission would allow the extension to access your email address linked with your Google account, useful for subscription management or personalization, with your consent.

#### identity
Gives the extension the ability to use your Google account's identity securely, potentially for features like seamless login or synchronization across devices, again, with your agreement.

These permissions are necessary for Helperbird to offer its full range of features, enhancing your web browsing experience while respecting your privacy and choice.


### Google Docs and Slides

Helperbird's integration with Google Docs and Slides is designed to enhance your experience by enabling features such as text reading, font customization, and language translation. We request the necessary `/auth/documents.currentonly` and `/auth/presentations.currentonly` authorizations for these functionalities. Rest assured, we do not track or store any user data in the process.

### Google Drive

To seamlessly send requested PDFs to the Helperbird browser extension for an improved reading experience, we ask for `/auth/drive.readonly` authorization. It's important to note that Helperbird respects your privacy and does not store or track any information obtained through this authorization.

### Data Security and Compliance

Helperbird is committed to the security and privacy of your data. Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs are strictly limited to our browser extension. We adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), ensuring responsible data handling and compliance with industry standards. You can also read our [security page here](/security/)

### No Tracking or Storage

## Verifiable Parental Consent

To comply with online safety regulations for children under 13, we require schools or teachers to obtain parental consent before allowing a student under 13 to allow Helperbird to know their email. This step is necessary for us to verify whether the student has access to Helperbird Pro or is included in a Helperbird Pro Unlimited subscription. It's important to clarify that **we're asking for the student's email, not for personal information, solely to check their subscription status.**

We prioritize privacy, which is why our **free version doesn't require users to log in or provide an email**. For those who opt for Helperbird Pro, **we offer a subscription key as an alternative**. This method allows access to Pro features while maintaining email privacy, ensuring users can enjoy our services without sharing more information than they're comfortable with.
