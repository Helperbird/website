## We're All About Access

We're here for everyone, always making our app better so it's easy for people with all kinds of
abilities to use. Standards always change, but we update our app every two weeks to make sure we're
always within the standard. We follow guidelines called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) to make sure our app is up to scratch.

## Keeping It Simple

We aim to keep everything we say clear and easy to understand, shooting for stuff that's just right
for 12 to 14-year-olds. This way, everyone can get what they need from the web without getting lost
in complicated words.

## Everywhere You Are

We're not just about one place online; we want to make sure our stuff is easy and fun for everyone
on any platform, including social media.

colors to make everything easier to read. No more squinting!
