## Overview

Your safety and privacy are super important to us. Plus, we want to make sure you have a great time using our app. Here's how we keep things secure and private, in a way that's easy for everyone to understand.


## Email and Payments

When you decide to use Helperbird Pro, we usually need your email. This helps us check if your payment or school status is good to go with Stripe. But guess what? If you’re not keen on sharing your email, there’s another way! You can use a [subscription key](https://www.helperbird.com/help/how-to-use-my-subscription-key/) instead. 

We respect your choice, so it's totally up to you. And just so you know, we don't keep or process your email info ourselves. It's just a step for when you’re getting started with Helperbird Pro.

## Enhanced Performance and Security
**Why AWS CloudFront?** We’ve chosen AWS CloudFront because it’s more than just a fast content delivery network. It’s a secure pathway that ensures your data travels safely across the internet. This technology protects against network and application-level attacks, meaning your information is guarded as it reaches you, no matter where you are in the world.

**Global Reach, Local Speed**: AWS CloudFront delivers your data from the nearest location to ensure speed without compromising security. This means faster app performance and robust protection against intrusion, ensuring a seamless and safe experience.

## Employee Security Measures

### Dual-Layer Protection
Our team employs two-step verification, an essential security layer that requires not just a password but also a second form of identification. This could be a code sent to a phone or a fingerprint. It’s like having two locks on your door; even if someone gets past the first, the second one keeps your data secure.

### Continuous Security Training
Our employees undergo regular security training to stay ahead of the latest threats. This proactive approach means we’re not just reacting to threats; we’re preventing them, ensuring our team is a strong line of defense for your data.

## Advanced Secure Coding Practices

### Building a Fortified App
Our commitment to security extends to the very core of our app. By employing secure coding practices, we ensure that every line of code is scrutinized for vulnerabilities. Our developers are trained in the latest security techniques, ensuring they build with defense in mind.

### Regular Security Audits 
We don’t just build and forget; we continuously review and improve our code. Regular security audits allow us to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the app remains a fortress against cyber threats.

### Staying Ahead of the Curve
The digital landscape is always changing, and so are the tactics of those looking to exploit it. That’s why we commit to ongoing education and updates in our security practices. By staying informed about the latest security trends and adapting our strategies accordingly, we ensure that our app and your data stay safe.

## Privacy by Design

### No Storage of Personal Info (Except for Stripe Payments)
We really care about keeping your personal details private. So, we only ask for the information we absolutely need. When it comes to paying for Helperbird Pro, we use Stripe - a payment service we trust to handle your payment details safely and efficiently. Apart from what's needed for Stripe, we don't keep any of your personal info.

### Helping Protect Privacy for Everyone
Through our open-source project, we contribute to privacy enhancement by developing tools that remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from datasets. This effort underlines our dedication to both user privacy and the broader community's security.

---

## Ongoing Vigilance

### Regular Updates and Reviews
We maintain the security and performance of our app with regular updates and code reviews. This proactive approach allows us to address vulnerabilities swiftly, ensuring ongoing security for our users.

### Data Breach Plan
Our comprehensive data breach plan outlines immediate actions to protect your information, demonstrating our commitment to your security even in the face of potential threats.
