At Helperbird, we take the privacy and security of our users very seriously. We do not track, collect or store any personal data, and we don't use any third-party apps or Google Analytics.

All data stored locally is for the sole purpose of customizing your experience and providing educational resources.

We require your email address to verify your payment status through Stripe. However, we do not process or store this information.

Our AWS node server provides additional security measures.

Individual settings relating to the Helperbird apps are not personal and are stored only on your device.

You may be prompted to grant access to your email and modify the current webpage. This is only to check your payment status and implement changes you requested. We do not process or have access to this information.
