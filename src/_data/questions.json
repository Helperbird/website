		{
			"question": "Why do some Helperbird features not work on Google Docs?",
			"answer": "Helperbird's features may not work on Google Docs due to a change in the way that Google Docs renders text using Canvas, a bitmap graphics API, rather than HTML.",
			"answer2": "Helperbird's custom fonts may not work on Google Docs due to a change in the way that Google Docs renders text. Google Docs used to use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to render text and other content within the document. However, they have recently switched to using a rendering engine called Canvas, which is a bitmap graphics API that is used to draw text and other elements onto a canvas element in an HTML document.<br>Since Canvas is a bitmap graphics API, it does not support the use of custom fonts in the same way that HTML does. As a result, Helperbird's custom fonts may not be compatible with Google Docs when using the Canvas rendering engine."
